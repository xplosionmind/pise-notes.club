# The existence of self

## Leibnitz

> Ab actu ad potentiam valet consequentia

If something exists, it means it's possible.

I am sure of what I perceive, “phenomena”. What I think exists for sure in my thoughts.

Which phenomena actually exist?

We can consider the phenomena itself or a relation of phenomena. A phenomenon is real if it is

> vivid, complex, and internally coherent (*congruum*: consistent in itself). It will be vivid if its qualities, such as light, color, and warmth, appear intense enough.

**vividness** appears in Hume too, since he read Leibnitz.

Different and varied sensory experiences make the object real.

Different phenomena are real if they are consistent in each other relations, too. Coherence also in time: if we can predict a behavior, we can prove reality.

And all af this was a dream, we should call it reality, since it's consistent, I can't prove its non-existence. **We can't prove the existence / non-existence of the world**. We have only a moral certainty, not a metaphysical one.

Coherence of the same experience **and** coherence with other experiences.

Through reasoning, we can attempt to include new events and experience in reality, and to describe it.

It's impossible that only on substance exists, other finite beings exist, yet not all the possible beings do.

The faces of reality

If our life were a dream, we can't accuse God of being a deceiver. We are deceived not by God, but by our judgement. We should be thankful to God for making them coherent among each other.

We are some expressions of the universe.

Why do the body-mind problem emerged after the Second World War: the need to find tools to substitute / improve human mind. Philosophy of mind emergend in that period to attempt to understand 

## What is the mind?

- **Dualism**: mind and body exist as different separate entities (Plato, Descartes, Leibnitz)
    - mind is spiritual
    - body is material
- **Monism**:
- **Tempered Monism**:

<br>

Descartes is a dualist and interactionist

interactionism: the two substances are different and separate, but they interact. E.g. a phisical stimulus corresponds to a stimulus to the mind.

## Second meditation

### 1. Searching for an Archimedean point

Proof of the principle of no contradiction, Aristoteles demonstrates that whoever wants to confute the principle of non-contradiction must accept the principle, because it's the basis of any argument.

The deceiving God, which is an argument against the existence of other entities, is instead an argument **in support** of the existence of the self. It's impossible to be deceived if not existing, no argument can question existence.

#### Elenchtic demonstration

From the Greek _Elenchos_

It's impossible to be deceived if not existing: the argument of the deceiving God, instead of questioning an individual existence, proof one's existence.

> We can… demonstrate negatively even that this view is impossible, if our opponent will only say something; and if he says nothing, it is absurd to seek to give an account of our views to one who cannot give an account of anything, in so far as he cannot do so. For such a man, as such, is from the start no better than a vegetable…The starting-point for all such arguments is not the demand that our opponent shall say that something either is or is not (for this one might perhaps take to be a begging of the question), but that he shall say something which is significant both for himself and for another; for this is necessary, if he really is to say anything. For, if he means nothing, such a man will not be capable of reasoning, either with himself or with another. But if any one grants this, demonstration will be possible; for we shall already have something definite. … And again he who admits this has admitted that something is true apart from demonstration (so that not everything will be 'so and not so’)

<br>

Only the subject can express this proposition. We now have a **model of knowledge**, we got a paradigm to clearly understand 

<br>
<br>

## The existence of the self

Aristotele's faculties of animals, three different **kind of souls**:
- Vegetative faculty (plants)
- Sensitive faculty (animals): motion
- Rational faculty (humans)

The higher functions carry out the lower ones, there is some sort of hierarchy

The corresponding faculties in Descartes:
- mind (instead of body)


Self-perception is a way of knowing the body (anticipation of the 6<sup>th</sup> meditation)

We don't only know we exist, we now know we are a **thinking thing**.

### The broad meaning of thinking

> I use this term [‘thought’, ‘cogitatio’] to include everything that is within us in such a way that we are immediately conscious of it. Thus all the operations of the will, the intellect, the imagination and the senses are thoughts. I say ‘immediately’ so as to exclude the consequences of thoughts: a voluntary movement for example, originates in a thought but is not itself a thought.

<p style="text-align: right">Descartes’s Second Set of Replies to his Meditations</p>

Descartes is strictly connecting the domain of thinking, consciousness with the domain of mind. Descartes is the first to identify consciousness (*conscientia*) with mind (*mens*). Before him, is only had its ethical meaning, the tool to define right or wrong. In contemporary philosophy, they're used as synonyms.

### The meaning of substance

The substance isn't linked to the individual. In Aristotheles, every being is a substance. Substance is extension: bodies are different modes of one substance.

> By substance we can understand nothing than a thing which exists in such a way as to depend on no other thing for its existence. 

The existence of the “I” is proved since it depend on no other thing. Therefore, it's a substance.

The proper sense of substance belongs only to God:

> And there is only one subject which can be understood to depend on no other thing whatsoever, namely God.

From here, Spinoza's definition of God.

#### Proving the existence of substance

> We can, however, easily come to know a substance by one of its <u>attributes</u>, in virtue of the common notion that nothingness possesses no attributes, that is ti say, no properties or qualities.

Furthermore,

> *To each substance there belongs <u>one principal attribute</u>; in the case of mind, this is thought, and in the case of body it is extension.*
>
> A substance may indeed be known through any attribute at all; but each substance has one principal property which constitutes its nature and essence, and to which all its other properties are referred.

Then, the “I” is proved through the attribute of thinking. The substance is independently proved to exist.

Self perception means to have the mental property, it's not a physical activity of the body.

In the second part of the second meditation, Descartes provides a counterargument to the common belief that since childhood, as newborns, we learn through the senses. Also the knowledge we define “sense perception” doesn't belong to the body, but to the mind.

It seems that sensory experience is easier to accept, the empirical level of knowledge is easier.

From an empirical approach: a body has several properties, which make me understand what it is. Nevertheless, those properties can change: the example of a piece of wax. Then, it's the mind which is able to state it's it.

There are infinite possibilities and ways a thing can change, thus it's not a product of imagination, since it will never be able to encompass it

A distinction between a confusing intellectual knowledge, derived from the senses, and a complete knowledge, from a <q>purely mental scrutiny</q>

My sensory experience is possible, it's meaningful, only because there is a mind which collects and organizes the data received from the senses

We always use our mind, also when we believe we're using the senses.

Even with Physics, even when talking about atoms, it's our intellect which allows us to understand the kink which bonds ice and water, knowing the matter is the same, yet the status is different. It's thanks to our mind we know it's always H<sub>2</sub>O.

The “enemy” of Descartes isn't the belief that science doesn't need empirical data, but the aristothelean idea that knowledge comes from the senses only. The point Descartes wants to prove is that science necessarily needs the mind to form theories

## Sixth Meditation

At the end of the second meditation there still is a critical unsolved question: do bodies exist?

In the sixth meditation, Descartes proves that God exists and it's not a deceiver: whatever we subjectively perceive is objectively true.

Fundamental points:
- The distinction between understanding (intellect) imagination and senses
- The argument for the real separation
- The demonstration of the **existence of bodies**
- The interaction between mind and body
- The function of sensations
- The cause of some errors of the senses

(in the 5th meditation, the true essence of the bodies. The existence of the external world is the last thing Descartes proves)

 Imagination means to use matter to represent a purely intellectual concept:
 
 > So the difference between this mode of thinking [imagining] and pure understanding may simply be this: when the mind understands, it in some way turns towards itself and inspects one of the ideas which are within it; but when it imagines, it turns towards the body and looks at something in the body which conforms to an idea understood by the mind or perceived by the senses.
 
 I can better explain it if other bodies exist, but this is not a proof yet.
 
 The existence of bodies can be proved because I can't choose not to feel or not to perceive something, if I could, then again the mind would be in control of everything. Since I can't, I must acknowledge that there ore other bodies.
 
 (Since God is the author of our being, it's powerful and he made us perfect.)
 
 I can infer (p. 61) that if two entities appear to me as separate, they are indeed different and not one. Thus, having proved that my mind is independent from my body, I can say that my body and my mind are separate and independent and I can live without my body.
 
 These two substances are detachable at least by God.
 
 The only possibility is that all of my perceptions come from a single +++
 
 Possibilities for sensory perceptions sources:
 
 - God
 - external bodies

Why can't it be God?

He hasn't given us the possibility to understand it's him (or it's not him) that gives us those ideas. There is no way for us to understand/prove it's him who give us those ideas.
 
 God doesn't directly give the sensory feelings to us, since doing this would make him a deceiver, since he gave us no faculty to understand the source of our impressions, which otherwise seem to come from external bodies

+++ beginning, repetition of immortality of bodies and definition of substance

What does it mean to die? Our individual body is destroyed, but the mind will continue to exist

The main act of thinking is being conscious of something: if I knew how the knowledge of the external comes to me, I'd be conscious of it.

Note: we're speaking about the demonstration of the existence of bodies, not their nature.

Sensory experience is truthful only in the case of understanding the existence of the bodies.

Leibnitz: we can only have a “moral certainty” the external world exists, we have no necessary and logic knowledge of it.

## Parallelism vs Occasionalism

Two conceptions of dualism which deny Interactionism. Mind and body can't interact.

Both of them state that to each mental event corresponds a physical event. The difference between them is in the power they give to limited entities

- **Parallelism**: mind and body are two clocks created at the beginning of time which show the same 

    Leibnitz: the causal power is in substance: each monade is an entry of an encyclopedia, in which is stores all the data about the events which will happen to it. The monad is the cause to all its events. The body of the monade is synced with its essence. There is no free will, but there is “freedom of spontaneity” and “Freedom on indifference”
- **Occasionalism**: God established laws for which every time I want to raise an hand, my body will raise an hand. To each physical state corresponds a mental state, predefined from God.

The causal power is only in God.
