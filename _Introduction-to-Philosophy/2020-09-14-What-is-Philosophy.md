## Terminology

From the Greek *philosophia*: *Philein*, to love, and *Sophia*, knowledge, wisdom.

For long time, some scholars conceived “Sophia” with two opposite interpretations:
- on one side, Philosophy as a way of liging life (practically)
- on another side, Philosophy as a way of theoretically conceiving the world and life

Most scholars, though, conceived these interpretations as close in meaning.

Philosophy is both, Pierre **Hadot** (quoting Philo of Alexandria) . Most philosophers saw both terms as a unique therm, Philosophy can change life. Wonder which makes us good citizens of the world. Understand nature to change our life and the ways we connect to each other. “Living in a festival”.

Philosophers are not just feeling this love. *Erasteuein*, whose root is *eros*, not *philein*. Something which involves us directly. To actually be **in love** with wisdom and knowledge. Tight connection between philosophy and love.

***Metis***: brain, smartness.

***Eros*** is always poor.

No God is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom, for he is wise already; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. Neither do the ignorant seek after wisdom.

We can love only if we acknowledge that we miss something.

Why Philein instead of Eros at the beginning

*Philein* is to love in general, love to anybody or anything. Several philosophers in different times noted and pointed out which philosophy isn't general love, but something which shakes our deep self. Philosophy isn’t just a task, it’s something which involves us deeply.

Philosophy is the only free science, because it has no real end, it has no purpose other than knowledge.

Strict connection between the search of knowledge and the fear of death. Survive death? Knowledge is the best way to fight the fear of death.

Our body is a prison for our soul, thus we have to free ourselves from it in order to philosophize.

Philosophy as a preparation to die, or else not to fear death. We have to live the fear in order to live the peace of the afterworld. It’s in our essence to be mortal. Nietzsche point of view close to the one of Montaigne, the common source of Epicurus.

(knowing the answer but not knowing the question, *[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)*)

We become free because we we know how to live and not fear. <q>He who has learned to die has unlearned to serve</q>

Is fear of death part of our nature? Not all philosophers conceived philosophy as a medium to understand death. Spinoza: we need not to feel negative emotions, since they make our being less powerful, we need passions which add power to our lives.

What we’re part of continues to exist even after we perish. The only way to be eternal is to think about eternal things, being conscious about eternal entities.

Being aware of ignorance is the first step to become a philosophy

## Kant


> Philosophy cannot be learned; we can at most learn to philosophize. Where is it, who posseses it, and how shall we know it? We can only learn to philosophize. In other words, we can only exercise our powers of reasoning in accordance with general principles, retaining, at the same time, the right to investigate the sources of these principles, to test, and even to reject them

~ *Critique of pure reason*, Doctrine of Method, 1781


We can’t have a definition, some precise notion of what it is, we just do it, it’s a way, a “how”, not a “what”. Philosophy isn’t something given, but an approach to reality. Not a set of knowledge, but an approach.

<br />

## Hegel

> This science [philosophy] must often submit to the slight of hearing even people who have never taken any trouble with it talking as if they thoroughly understood all about it. With no preparation beyond an ordinary education they do not hesitate, especially under the influence of religious sentiment, to philosopise and  to criticize philosophy. Everybody allows that to know any other science you must have first studied it, and that you can only claim to express a judgment upon it in virtue of such knowledge. Everybody allows that to make a shoe you must have learned and practiced the craft of the shoemaker, though every man has a model in his own foot, and possesses in his hands the natural endowments [≈skills] for the operations required. For philosophy alone, it seems to be imagined, such study, care, and application are not in the least requisite.

~ *Encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences*, § 5, 1817

People think they can understand philosophy and philosophize because they can reason, but philosophy as to be studied, before, to be understood and criticized.

We have to know something (have the necessary tools) in order to philosophize. Not anybody who can think can philosophize.

<br />

## Jaspers

> the Greek word for philosopher (*philosophos*) connotes a distinction from *sophos*. It signifies the lover of wisdom (knowledge) as distinguished from those who consider them wise in possession of knowledge… the essence of philosophy is not the possession of the truth but the search for it. Philosophy means to be on the way. **Its questions are more essential than its answers, and every answer becomes a new question**.

~ *Way to wisdom. An introduction to Philosophy* (1950)

Love for knowledge as opposed to thinking to possess knowledge. The essence is searching for the truth, not possessing (or believing to possess) it. The search makes Philosophy, not the final findings

<br />

## Nagel

> The main concern of philosophy is to question and understand very common ideas that all of us use every day without thinking about them. A historian may ask what happened at some time in the past, but a philosopher will ask, “What is time?’… Anyone can ask whether it’s wrong to sneak into a movie without paying, but a philosopher will ask “What makes an action right or wrong?”.
>
> We couldn’t get along in life without taking the ideas of time, number, knowledge, language, right and wrong for granted most of time; but in Philosophy we investigate those things themselves. The aim is to push **understanding of the world and ourselves a bit deeper**. Obviously, it isn't easy.

~ *What does it all mean?* (1987)

The point is’t taking a position or strongly fight for a belief, but dive into the roots of the original questions and try to understand them.
