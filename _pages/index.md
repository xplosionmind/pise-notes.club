## Purpose

The final aim of this website is to create an open set of resources for PISE students, allowing us to join forces and study in the most effective way by sharing notes and knowledge across different years of the degree and different areas of interest.

<br>

## Completeness and reliability

This website is mantained and updated by a first year clumsy PISE student: <mark>its content may be incomplete or not totally reliable</mark>; I keep track of what I lost during the lessons in the [[missing|missing page]]. **Many** topics may be missing but by [[Contribute|contributing]] you can help in filling the gaps.

## Legend of symbols

Since up to now content comes only from Tommi's notes, there are several gaps and notes may be inconsistent.

- `+++`: missing parts
- `???`:
	- unclear passages
	- questions
- `grm`: doubts about grammar
- `+++S`: copy from slides
- `“+++”`: exact citation of the professor missing
- `(+++)`: there's a missing knowledge to what has just been written
