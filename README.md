# Notes from PISE Classes

These are the notes I take while attending [***Philosophy, International Studies and Economics***](https://unive.it/pise) classes at [Ca' FOscari University](https://unive.it) in Venice.

<br>

## Purpose

The final aim of this repository is to create an open set of resources for PISE students, allowing us to join forces and study in the most effective way by sharing notes and knowledge across different years and topics.

My idea is to eventually make it a Jekyll website in order to make its content accessible to non-geek students too. Nevertheless, as you can see, as of right now I'm the only contributor and tbh my notes are far from being complete or insightful.

## Note

Ideas on how to improve this repo, as well as development milestones, are all noted in the [development page](./development.md)

## Contribution

Please fel free to fork, share, improve this repo as you like; the only requisite for contribution is to be a PISE student, former student, or professor.
