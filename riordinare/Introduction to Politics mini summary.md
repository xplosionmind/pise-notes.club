The debt is a stock variable, measured at a specific point in time, and it is the accumulation of all prior deficits. Government debt can be categorised as internal debt (owed to lenders within the country) and external debt (owed to foreign lenders).</p></td><td><p><strong>13) <u>FISCAL CLIFF</u></strong></p><p><u>The fiscal cliff refers to a combination of expiring tax cuts and across-the-board government spending cuts that create a looming imbalance in the federal budget and must be corrected to avert a crisis.</u></p><p><strong>14) <u>INEQUALITY</u></strong></p><p>Since the <u>1970’s</u>, Americans’ incomes have grown less equal and the middle class smaller. The rich get a bigger slice of the nation’s economic pie; the poor and much of the middle class get smaller pieces. T<u>hose with the right education and skills may do well, but those with a high-school education or less do poorly.</u></p><p><strong>15) <u>BUBBLES</u></strong></p><p>Financial markets tend to produce “<strong>bubbles</strong>,” fast growth in investments that let people ignore risk—until the bubbles pop. Some economists blame alternating <strong>manias</strong> and <strong>panics</strong>, both heavily psychological, what Keynes called the “animal spirits” of investor irrationality. He urged government intervention to dampen both.</p><p><strong>-.-</strong></p><p><em><u>WHAT IS POVERTY?</u></em></p><ul><li><p>Defining poverty can be tricky, as what’s “poor” currently might have been “comfortable” in previous eras</p></li><li><p><strong>Liberals</strong> complain that the poverty line is set much too low; it can take two to three times that to survive in big cities, as rent and child care are now bigger items than food</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservatives</strong> point out that poverty figures do not include <em>non-cash</em> benefits transferred to the poor by government programs — food stamps, for example</p></li></ul><p><em><u>WELFARE VS ENTITLEMENTS</u></em></p><ul><li><p>The federal budget is divided into:</p></li></ul><ol type="1"><li><p><strong><u>DISCRETIONARY</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>Can be raised or lowered from year to year.

The Carter administration simplified the program in <u>1977</u> by eliminating the provision that recipients <em>buy</em> the stamps at a discount with their own money. This policy had meant that the absolutely destitute could get no food stamps.</p><p>The Food Stamp program became bigger than expected, but fraud and waste have not been major factors. Only a few recipients sold food stamps at 50 cents on the dollar to buy liquor and drugs, and all food stamps are now debit cards, which fights the fraud problem.</p><ol start="3" type="1"><li><p><strong><u>WELFARE REFORM</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>The <u>1996</u> reform signed by President Clinton replaced entitlement-type welfare payments with block grants to the states to spend fighting poverty as they saw fit. Recipients had five years to get off welfare. Many states developed <strong>workfare</strong> programs that required recipients to either take jobs or training.</p><ol start="4" type="1"><li><p><strong><u>HEALTHCARE REFORM</u></strong></p></li></ol><p><u>At least two factors induce exponential growth in medical assistance: more people become eligible and medical costs soar</u>. Medicare is especially expensive, for all get it upon reaching age sixty-five, even rich people.</p><p>Hospitals and doctors, once they are assured of payment, have no incentive to economise. When in doubt, they put the patient in the hospital — at $1,000 and more a day — and order expensive tests. Some hospitals expanded into medical palaces, and some physicians got rich from Medicare and Medicaid. Washington tried various ways of tightening up, but medical costs continued to climb.</p><p><em><u>HOW BIG SHOULD GOVERNMENT BE?</u></em></p><ul><li><p>The American welfare state is small compared with that of other advanced industrialised countries = should it get bigger?</p></li><li><p>The American answer, rooted in its political culture, is to keep government small and to suspect and criticise the expansion of government power</p></li><li><p>But we also recognise that we need government intervention in the economy, education, energy planning, environmental protection, and health care</p></li></ul></td><td><ul><li><p>The rash of political violence in the <u>1960’s</u> changed that perspective and led to the argument that <u>political systems do decay and break down over time</u>; this decay is often marked by <strong>riots, civil wars, terrorism, coups</strong>, and <strong>authoritarian governments</strong></p></li><li><p>Breakdowns begin when legitimacy erodes; <strong>legitimacy</strong> is <u>the feeling by citizens that government should be obeyed</u></p></li><li><p>Generally, legitimacy erodes as government shows that it is ineffective in solving the myriad of problems</p></li><li><p>P<u>olitical violence does not necessarily mean that a revolution is near, and in fact, often government takes steps to avoid a revolution once political violence manifests</u></p></li><li><p>Violence can be:</p></li></ul><ol type="1"><li><p><strong><u>PRIMORDIAL</u></strong></p></li></ol><p>Grows out of conflicts between basic communities.
