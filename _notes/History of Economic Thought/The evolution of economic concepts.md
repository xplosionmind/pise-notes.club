## Deductive method

### Hypothetical deductive

- The **scholastic school** is based on a general abstract premise, defined by **Christian prescriptions**.
- [Phisiocracy] put <u>agriculture</u> at the center of economical growth; from its maximization followed the other aspects of economy. It became one of the first well-developed economical theories.
- The characteristic of **Mainstream economics**, included the [Neoclassical school], assume that <u>all individuals take rational decisions</u>.  
  While the [Austrian school] uses the verbal model, the [Neoclassical school] uses the mathematical model.

<br>

### Historical deductive

- The [Classical school] and **Marxism** focus on social and economic facts, considered the sources of everything else. Such matters are <u>strictly related to time</u>, but <u>independent from the location</u>.
- [Keynesianism] supports that the economy is <u>driven by the demand</u>
- According to [Evolutionarism], growth is driven by <u>endogenous innovation</u>

<br>
<br>

## Inductive method


- [William Petty] states that Economics is <u>based on numbers</u>
- The [Historical school] and [Institutionalism] supported that single countries’ experience was the starting point for economic studies.

<br>

[Mercantilism], instead, had a mixed approach:
- **Hyp-Ded**: gold is the main source of wealth and power
- **His-Ded**: minor premises based on historical events

<br>
<br>

The evolution of economic ideas is entangled with the evolution of economic systems, and different schools not only use different methods, but they attribute different relevance to **time** and **location**.
- according to the [Neoclassical school], <u>the economy does not change over time or space</u>, since it follows general global rules.  
if Economics is based on general, **unchanging** laws, <u>history of economic thought is useless</u>. (ME)
- Classical and Marxist schools argue that time is strictly relevant to assess economic issues, while economical laws are independent from the country
- according to Historical and Institutional schools, and William Petty, economics <u>changes both over time and space</u>.
- According to Mercantilism, only the minor premises, since they are based on historical facts, are time-dependent.

If the evolution of society and its history have a great influence on Economics, such history must be studied in order to handle in the best possible way current Economical problems.

## Timeline

A quick timeline with the highlights of the economic development:
1. **primitive** hunter societies (until 799BC) but the watershed moment for the development of the economy was the discovery of **agriculture**.
2. **slave-based** economies (800BC to 476AD), with a fundamental **hierarchical structure**
	- Greek civilization: decentralized city-states
	- Roman empire: great empire with centralized power
3. **Feudalism**: from 476AD to the 16<sup>th</sup> century, in the lowest class **slaves** are replaced serves, who are linked to their landlords with a contract, which guarantees them remuneration. Society is based on **manors**, in which the economy is autonomous, therefore there is little room for trading; the only trading activity takes place among cities.
Manors are **self-sufficient** and everything is controlled by **guilds**, therefore there is <u>no incentive for innovation</u>.
4. The rise of [Mercantilism] was born from the discovery of <u>new lands</u>, which created the premises to <u>develop global trade routes</u> organized by **merchants**. In Big colonialist nation-states arise and start competing with each other.  
  The trade of prime matter, first above all **gold**, increased wealth, and it started to be defined as the <u>quantity of gold and silver</u> owned by a state. It emerged a division among mercantilists concerning how gold changes the economy:
	- according to some, <u>more money meant more wealth</u>
	- according to others, <u>more money meant higher prices</u>
Such events led merchants to use their growing wealth to organize <u>rudimental <strong>manufacturing activities</strong></u>, which started developing in UK and were focused mainly on the **textile sector**; such proto-capitalist industries were defined “**cottage-industries**”.

5. **Capitalism** was born in the 1750s and still lives. Its development is due to the great amount of capital that merchants gained from trade, which was spent on <u>advanced expensive industrial machinery</u>.
	1. In the early stage of Capitalism (1750s to 1850s), the main interest for firm owners was **profit**, since it determined the development of activities ($x \cdot{} P_{x} - \text{\emph{cost of prod.}}$); this led to **workers exploitation**. ***Dark ages of Capitalism***, also known as Industrial capitalism. Such societal structure led Marx to develop his theories.
	2. **Financial Capitalism** (1900s to 1980s): increase in employees wages &rarr; emergence of a wealthy middle class with a great amount of savings to invest. The financial market added a factor of **instability**: a fluctuation in growth due to booms and recessions. This is when Keynes introduced his theory.
	3. **Global capitalism** (from the 1980s): a strong interaction among countries, a bi-directional flows of activities, goods, knowledge and expertise. These flows originated what was called **spillover effect**: the growth and crises of a country influenced also other countries’ economies
