[Classical economics], also defined as Political economy, is the mainstream economics of the XVIII and XIX centuries. Its father is the Scottish philosopher [Adam Smith] (1723 - 1790), but it has been supported by several other important figures such as [Jean-Baptiste Say], [Thomas Robert Malthus], and [David Ricardo]. [Karl Marx] may be included in this group, too, since he used the Classical school’s tools even if he criticized it.

These scholars lived in the age of [industrial Capitalism] (1750s-1900s). **Profit** was entrepreneurs’ primary focus since they needed capital to buy the very expensive machinery which was the hallmark of that period.

The amount of money ($M$) invested in machinery and to pay workers to produce a certain commodity ($C$) is smaller than the final value ($M^{\prime}$):

$$
M \rightarrow C \rightarrow M^{\prime}
$$

Not being able to determine with absolute certainty that $M^{\prime} > M$ led to **exploitation of workers**, which, associated to a growing population, resulted in **low wages**.

Such conditions set the background for the development of classical economic theories, that show some common fundamental ideas:
1. an interest in growth and development, which were believed to culminate in a stationary state, meaning a state where the economy would only **reproduce** itself and ending up in a context of **zero growth**, hence <u>a pessimistic view on the capability of capitalism to continue to provide growth in the long term</u>.
2. a focus on the **cost of production** as the main factor influencing the price, therefore the value of goods should at least match the cost sustained by entrepreneurs.
3. the concern on on the **distribution of income** among labor, land and capital in the form of, respectively, wages, rents and profits; it was thus important to study the **fairness** of the capitalistic system.

## Adam Smith

### Life

[Adam Smith] was born in 1723 in [Kirkcaldy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkcaldy "Kirkcaldy on Wikipedia"), in [Fife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife "Fife on Wikipedia"), Scotland. While attending [Francis Hutcheson]’s lectures at the University of Glasgow, he was strongly influenced him and he got close to [[David Hume]].  
Smith continued his studied at Oxford and in 1751 became a professor of Logic and successively of Moral Philosophy ad its *alma mater*.

<br>

### Motivations of human actions

The motivations for human actions are considered fundamental by Smith, who was influenced in this regard by Hutcheson’s idea that <u>men are not purely self-interested</u>. Smith argued that men are governed by **self-interest,** but moderated by **sympathy** for other’s interests, therefore the ability to share feelings. Every action is evaluated on the basis of its effects on others. Such evaluations evolve around two different kinds of sympathy:
- **approval by individuals**, approval by people closer to someone and their direct influence
- **approval by community**, approval by the community someone belongs to

The prerogative for a well functioning society is the pursuit of one’s own interests while ensuring to be loved by the close and broad community they live in.

<br>

### Government’s role

Self interest and its mitigation based on sympathy form the fundamentals of Smith’s renowned theory of the **invisible hand*** which provides beneficial outcomes for the whole society.

Every individual acts out of **self interest**
&darr;
This might lead to a **chaotic mix** of products and prices, but…
&darr;
…other self-interested people provide **competition**—<u>they take advantage of each other’s greed</u>
&darr;
If a seller **charges too much**, another will **undercut his price**, and the first seller’s products will fail to be sold.  
at the same time, if one employer pays wages that are **too low**, another will **take his employees** and his firm will fail
&darr;
Businesses fail unless they pay market wages and **make products the market demands** at the price people are willing to pay.
&darr;
The invisible hand of the market brings order.

Nevertheless, Smith points out in the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Wealth of Nations on Wikipedia">The Wealth of Nations</a></cite> that the invisible hand frequently promotes a social benefit, but not always: when <q>natural liberty</q>, or <q>freedom of action</q>, conflicts with the interests of the whole society, **justice measures** should be taken.

> … But \[those\] exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws of all governments

Government intervention is considered positive by Smith in some specific cases:
1. Maintaining the national defense;
2. Administrating justice
3. undertaking public works where they are privately unprofitable, but beneficial for the society;
4. subsidizing mass education.

At the same time, Smith remains skeptical about the Government intervening in the economy. He holds is position in opposition to Mercantilists, because regulations are carried out by lobbying merchants and manufacturers, leading to an inefficient resources allocation.  
Hence, Smith is considered a supporter of <em lang="fr">laissez faire</em> economy, and even though he did not considered free market as perfect, <u>its results are better than the economic regulations</u> introduced in England at his time.

<br>

### Determinants of national wealth

According to Smith, among the most important objectives of economics there is the study of the <q>nature and causes of the wealth of nations</q> such wealth is defined by what today is the **per capita income**, which depends on two factors:
1. employees’ productivity
2. The share of citizens employed in the production process

Hence, productivity ($Pr$) amounts to income ($Y$) divided by employees’ number ($L$):

<span id="formula-1">Formula 1</span>:
$$
Pr=\frac{Y}{L} \qquad \rightarrow \qquad \frac{Y}{N}=\frac{L}{N}\cdot Pr
$$

As displayed in [Formula 1](#formula-1), it derives that per-capita income ($\frac{Y}{N}$) is equal to the working portion of the population times the productivity level.

#### Division of labor

According to Smith, the latter depends chiefly on **division of labor**. He explains its effectiveness by the example of the pin factory.

When workers concentrate on **one single task**…
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&darr;
…repetition increases **skills** and **speed**, while **no time** is wasted through switching between tasks.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&darr;
This **increases production** and **reduces costs**:
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&darr;
<u>Divide up pin production in order to get more pins</u>.

In conclusion, division of labor is connected to productivity for the following main reasons:
1. Worker’s skills improvement by refining his focus on a task
2. Avoiding time loss due to the shift from one task to another by the same person
3. technical progress made such focus possible

The Scottish philosopher acknowledged that radical and strict division of labor could brutalize man, regardless of her/his intelligence. Nevertheless, he considered the pros of this system more important than its cons.

#### Size of the market

Smiths also points out that division of labor can be introduced if the **size of the market** it is applied to is large enough. The factors by which the latter depends on are:
1. The average liquidity available to consumers;
2. the level of liberal (free-market) policies introduced by public authorities;
3. the level of development of transport and communications.

According to the formula above, the result is that productivity increases, and it follows a growth of per-capita income, which eventually leads to a further expansion of the market.

#### Productive and unproductive labor

Adam Smith underscores the difference between productive labor and unproductive labor. The former is the labor which actually produces goods and commodities, while the latter provides services to capitalists; therefore, <u>the number of employees in unproductive labor should be minimized in order to maximize market growth</u>.

#### Accumulation

As his predecessors, Smith believes that the economy is able to produce a **surplus**. Such net product can be employed or invested in productive activities, by increasing the capital stock and leading to economic development.  
The <u>productive utilization of surplus</u> is called accumulation, and it consists not only in investments to improve the production process, but also in subsistence for more workers.

#### Productive workers

The number of active/productive workers ($\frac{L}{N}$) depends on:
1. The stage reached by the process of accumulation
2. institutional policies and customs, such as laws, average education, female workforce.

<br>

### Economic growth and stationary economy

Since division of labor triggers a chain of reactions which rapidly increase the growth rate of the economy, it is important to investigate <u>what compels the society to constantly seek economic growth</u> and <u>how can it be ascertained that such growth won’t stop</u>.

According to Smith, all societies are characterized by an insatiable <u>desire of improving</u>, which, in modern ones, translates to the desire to increase revenues.

> The consideration of his own profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in manufactures, on in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade.

<p class="cite">Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>, p. 355</p>

Therefore, **profit** is <u>both the purpose and the cause</u> for the standard entrepreneur.  
Smith claims that, thanks to competition, profit rates of different branches of the market should be equal or tend to equality.
<dl><b><dd>Profit rates</dd></b>
<dt>the relative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Profit_(accounting) on Wikipedia">profitability</a> of an investment project, a capitalist enterprise or a whole capitalist economy. It is the total profit expressed as a percentage of invested capital during the production process</dt></dl>

Regarding the limit in increase of profit, instead:

> The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same society, the same competition must produce the same effect in them all.

<p class="cite">Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>, p.87</p>

According to the passage above, we may conclude that <u>competition tends to reduce profit rates</u>. Nevertheless this contrasts with [Formula 1](#formula-1): an increase in productivity of labor improves the number of workers, too; hence, if the second member of the equation grows, the first, determined by profits, should increase accordingly, while Smith is stating the opposite.  
Such misleading affirmation highlights Smith’s overall optimism: capital accumulation can increase both productivity and employment (???).

<br>

### Division of social classes

Society is divided by Smith in three classes:
1. **Workers**, who are essential for the capitalistic economy, but they don’t directly contribute to the increase of the wealth of a nation. They live of wages which are enough for subsistence thanks to:
	- capitalists’ capability of influencing laws concerning workers’ rights
	- workers’ competition among each other on the labor market
2. **capitalists**, living of market profits; hence they have great 
3. landlords, living of rents.

Such division perfectly reflects the society of his age, but is not valid today, since landlords’ relevance succumbed to the importance of the middle class.
