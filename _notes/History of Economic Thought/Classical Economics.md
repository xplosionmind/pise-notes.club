[Classical economics], also defined as Political economy, is the mainstream economics of the XVIII and XIX centuries. Its father is the Scottish philosopher [Adam Smith] (1723 - 1790), but it has been supported by several other important figures such as [Jean-Baptiste Say], [Thomas Robert Malthus], and [David Ricardo]. [Karl Marx] may be included in this group, too, since he used the Classical school’s tools even if he criticized it.

These scholars lived in the age of [industrial Capitalism] (1750s-1900s). **Profit** was entrepreneurs’ primary focus since they needed capital to buy the very expensive machinery which was the hallmark of that period.

The amount of money ($M$) invested in machinery and to pay workers to produce a certain commodity ($C$) is smaller than the final value ($M^{\prime}$):

$$
M \rightarrow C \rightarrow M^{\prime}
$$

Not being able to ensure that $M^{\prime} > M$ led to **exploitation of workers**, which, associated to a growing population, resulted in **low wages**.

Such conditions set the background for the development of classical economic theories, that show some common fundamental ideas:
1. an interest in growth and development, which were believed to culminate in a stationary state, meaning a state where the economy would only **reproduce** itself and ending up in a context of **zero growth**, hence <u>a pessimistic view on the capability of capitalism to continue to provide growth in the long term</u>.
2. a focus on the **cost of production** as the main factor influencing the price, therefore the value of goods should at least match the cost sustained by entrepreneurs.
3. the concern on on the **distribution of income** among labor, land and capital in the form of, respectively, wages, rents and profits; it was thus important to study the **fairness** of the capitalistic system.
