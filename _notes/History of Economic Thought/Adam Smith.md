## Life

[Adam Smith] was born in 1723 in [Kirkcaldy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkcaldy "Kirkcaldy on Wikipedia"), in [Fife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife "Fife on Wikipedia"), Scotland. While attending [Francis Hutcheson]’s lectures at the University of Glasgow, he was strongly influenced by him and he got close to [[David Hume]].  
Smith continued his studies at Oxford, in 1751 he returned to its *alma mater* where he became a professor of Logic and successively of Moral Philosophy.

<br>

## Motivations of human actions

The motivations for human actions are considered fundamental by Smith, who was influenced in this regard by Hutcheson’s idea that <u>men are not purely self-interested</u>. Smith argued that men are governed by **self-interest,** but moderated by **sympathy** for other’s interests, therefore the ability to share feelings. Every action is evaluated on the basis of its effects on others. Such evaluations evolve around two different kinds of sympathy:
- **approval by individuals**, approval by people closer to someone and their direct influence
- **approval by community**, approval by the community someone belongs to

<div class="box">
	The prerogative for a well functioning society is the pursuit of one’s own interests while ensuring to be loved by the close and broad community they live in.
</div>

<br>

## Government’s role

Self interest and its mitigation based on sympathy form the fundamentals of Smith’s renowned theory of the ***[invisible hand]***, which provides beneficial outcomes for the whole society.

[invisible hand]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand 'Invisible hand on Wikipedia'

Every individual acts out of **self interest**&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;This might lead to a **chaotic mix** of products and prices, but…&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;…other self-interested people provide **competition**—<u>they take advantage of each other’s greed</u>&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;if a seller **charges too much**, another will **undercut his price**, and the first seller’s products will fail to be sold.&emsp;at the same time, if one employer pays wages that are **too low**, another will **take his employees** and his firm will fail&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;Businesses fail unless they pay market wages and **make products the market demands** at the price people are willing to pay.&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;The invisible hand of the market brings order.

Nevertheless, in the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Wealth of Nations on Wikipedia">The Wealth of Nations</a></cite> Smith points out that the invisible hand frequently promotes a social benefit, but not always: when <q>natural liberty</q>, or <q>freedom of action</q>, conflicts with the interests of the whole society, **justice measures** should be taken.

> … But \[those\] exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws of all governments

Government intervention is considered positive by Smith in some specific cases:
1. Maintaining the national defense;
2. Administrating justice;
3. undertaking public works where they are privately unprofitable, but beneficial for the society;
4. subsidizing mass education.

At the same time, Smith remains skeptical about the Government intervening in the economy. He holds his position against Mercantilists, because in their economic view regulations are carried out by <u>lobbying merchants and manufacturers</u>, leading to an <u>inefficient resources allocation</u>.  
Hence, Smith is considered a supporter of <em lang="fr">laissez faire</em> economy, and even though he did not considered free market as perfect, <u>its results are better than the economic regulations</u> introduced in England at his time.

<br>

## Determinants of national wealth

According to Smith, among the most important objectives of economics there is the study of the <q>nature and causes of the wealth of nations</q> such wealth is defined by what today is the **per-capita income**, which depends on two factors:
1. employees’ productivity
2. The share of citizens employed in the production process

Hence, productivity ($Pr$) amounts to income ($Y$) divided by employees’ number ($L$):

<span id="formula-1">Formula 1</span>:
$$
Pr=\frac{Y}{L} \qquad \rightarrow \qquad \frac{Y}{N}=\frac{L}{N}\cdot Pr
$$

As displayed in [Formula 1](#formula-1), it derives that per-capita income ($\frac{Y}{N}$) is equal to the working portion of the population times the productivity level.

<br>
<br>

## Division of labor

According to Smith, productivity level depends chiefly on **division of labor**. He explains its effectiveness with the example of the pin factory.

When workers concentrate on **one single task**&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;…repetition increases **skills** and **speed**, while **no time** is wasted through switching between tasks.&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;This **increases production** and **reduces costs**:&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;<u>Divide up pin production in order to get more pins</u>.

In conclusion, division of labor is connected to productivity for the following main reasons:
1. Worker’s skills improvement by refining his focus on a task
2. Avoiding time loss due to the shift from one task to another by the same person
3. technical progress made such focus possible

The Scottish philosopher acknowledged that radical and strict division of labor could brutalize man, regardless of her/his intelligence. Nevertheless, he considered the pros of this system more important than its cons.

<br>
<br>

## Size of the market

Smiths also points out that division of labor can be introduced if the **size of the market** it is applied to is large enough. The factors by which the latter depends on are:
1. The average liquidity available to consumers;
2. the level of liberal (free-market) policies introduced by public authorities;
3. the level of development of transport and communications.

According to the formula above, the result is that productivity increases, and it follows a growth of per-capita income, which eventually leads to a further expansion of the market.

<br>
<br>

## Productive and unproductive labor

Productive labor actually produces goods and commodities, while unproductive labor provides services to capitalists; therefore, <u>the number of employees in unproductive labor should be minimized in order to maximize market growth</u>.

<br>

### Accumulation

As his predecessors, Smith believes that the economy is able to produce a **surplus**. Such net product can be employed or invested in productive activities, by increasing the capital stock and leading to economic development.  
The <u>productive utilization of surplus</u> is called accumulation, and it consists not only in <u>investments to improve the production process</u>, but also in <u>subsistence for more workers</u>.

<br>

### Productive workers

The number of active/productive workers ($\frac{L}{N}$) depends on:
1. The stage reached by the process of accumulation
2. institutional policies and customs, such as laws, average education, female workforce.

<br>
<br>

## Economic growth and stationary economy

Since division of labor triggers a chain of reactions which rapidly increase the growth rate of the economy, it is important to investigate <u>what compels the society to constantly seek economic growth</u> and <u>how can it be ascertained that such growth will not stop</u>.

According to Smith, all societies are characterized by an insatiable <u>desire of improving</u>, which translates to the desire to increase revenues, in modern times.

> The consideration of his own profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in manufactures, on in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade.

<p class="cite">Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>, p. 355</p>

Therefore, **profit** is <u>both the purpose and the cause</u> for the standard entrepreneur.  
Smith claims that, thanks to competition, profit rates of different branches of the market <u>should be equal or tend to equality</u>.

<dl><b><dd>Profit rates</dd></b>
<dt>the relative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Profit_(accounting) on Wikipedia">profitability</a> of an investment project, a capitalist enterprise or a whole capitalist economy. It is the total profit expressed in proportion to the capital invested during the production process</dt></dl>

Regarding the limit in increase of profit, instead:

> The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same society, the same competition must produce the same effect in them all.

<p class="cite">Smith, <cite>The Wealth of Nations</cite>, p.87</p>

According to the passage above, we may conclude that <u>competition tends to reduce profit rates</u>. Nevertheless this contrasts with [Formula 1](#formula-1): an increase in productivity of labor improves the number of workers, too; hence, if the second member of the equation grows, the first, determined by profits, should increase accordingly, while Smith is stating the opposite.  
Such misleading affirmation highlights Smith’s overall optimism: capital accumulation is believed to increase both productivity and employment (???).

<br>

## Division of social classes

Society is divided by Smith in three classes:
1. **Workers**, who are essential for the capitalistic economy, but <u>they do not directly contribute increasing of the wealth</u> of a nation. They live of wages which are enough for subsistence thanks to:
	- capitalists’ capability of influencing laws concerning workers’ rights
	- workers’ competition among each others on the labor market
2. **capitalists**, living of market profits; hence they have great propensity towards capital accumulation.
3. **landlords**, living of rents.

Such division perfectly reflects the society of his age, but is not valid today, since <u>landlords’ relevance succumbed to the importance of the middle class</u>.

According to Smith, agricultural activities are not the only ones to produce surplus, which can be obtained by any production activity, in particular by the industrial sector. Additionally , it is the <u>result of human work</u>. What interests the economist is the problem of how surplus can be **measured** and how it is **distributed** among the social classes. These issues are addressed by the Theory of Value.

<br>
<br>

## Theory of Value

The [Theory of value] explains the exchange relationships among classes. It is one of the most relevant contributions to Economics by Smith and his fellow classical theorists, because it forms the basis of the functioning of an economic system divided in sectors and social classes and sectors that guarantee the functioning of the economic system.

<br>

### Example

Suppose an economy composed exclusively by the agricultural sector and by two classes: workers and farmers. To produce a certain quantity of grain ($G$), a farmer uses seeds ($s$) and labor ($L$):

$$
G = f(s;L)
$$

These two social classes have to exchange goods to ensure the stability of the social system: farmers buy labor from workers, and workers buy grain from farmers. Value of grain must be such as to guarantee:
1. a profit for farmers to regain the cost of the seeds, exploited in the production process
2. a purchasing ability subsistence goods for workers

<br>

According to some principles, the theory of value can be applied to more complex economical systems.

- **Value in use**: the utility of owning a specific good
- **Value in exchange**: the power of a commodity to purchase other goods, observed the market
	- **market price**: the price <u>determined by demand and supply</u>, observed in the market in a certain period
	- **natural price**
		- a theoretical price, consisting of the reproduction conditions of the economy<span class="wtf">???</span>
		- the price enabling workers to survive and firms to obtain sufficient profits in order to continue production in the future.<span class="wtf">???</span>

<br>

### Determining the Natural Price

Smith uses the term <q>natural price</q> and sometimes he refers to it as <q>value</q> and <q>price</q>; this makes it harder to determine his method for quantifying the natural price. Three different interpretations of his theory were given by other scholars.

#### Labor embodied

The value of a commodity corresponds to the <u>quantity of labor</u> used for its production.  
The problem of this theory is that it cannot work in civilizations which are not primitive and which <u>do not have social classes subdivision</u>.

Assuming that:
- it is produced only one good (grain, $X_g$)
- $X_g$ is produced by using labor ($L$) and seeds ($K$, where $K < X_g$, since $K$ is the portion of grains used as seeds)
- no rents payment is involved in the process

$$
\lambda{}X_{g} = L + \lambda{}K
$$

where $\lambda$:= total quantity of labor needed to produce one unit of $X_g$

$$
\lambda = I + \lambda{}k \qquad \rightarrow \qquad \lambda{}=\frac{I}{1-k}
$$

where $I=\frac{L}{X_g}$ and $k=\frac{K}{X_g}$

#### Labor commanded

The value of a commodity is the quantity of labor needed to obtain a salary ($w$) corresponding to the value ($p$) of the commodity itself, or the quantity of labor a given commodity can purchase.

Taking the same assumptions of LE, the value of $X_g$ in monetary terms is

$$
p_g X_g = L \cdot (wp_g) + p_{g}K + p_{g}V x
$$

$$
p_g X_g = L \cdot (wp_g) + p_{g}K + p_{g}\pi{}K
$$

dividing by $X_g$ and then by $\omega$

$$
p_g = l\omega + p_{g}k + p_{g}\pi{}k \qquad \rightarrow \qquad \frac{p_g}{\omega}=\frac{I}{1-(1+\pi{})k}
$$

where
- $w$:= salary expressed in quantity of grain;
- $V$:= quantity of grain received by capitalists as profit
- $\pi$:= the profit rate, equal to $V\over{K}$
- $\omega$:= salary in monetary terms
