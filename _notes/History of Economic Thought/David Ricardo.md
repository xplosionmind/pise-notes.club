[David Ricardo] (1772-1823) was an English economist, one of the greatest exponents of the Classical School. During his life, he grew interested in the economic situation of his country. In particular, he focused his attention on the debate concerning **Corn Laws**, which caused a continental block and during the Napoleonic wars opposite ideas about his suppression or prosecution emerged.  
Ricardo was in favor of abolishing duties since they would have increased the price of grain; a rise in the price of wheat would increase both rents and wages, and reduce profits.

## Theory of rent and diminishing returns

Elaborated in response to the Corn Law debate, this theory was first discovered by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], but Ricardo made it clearer and more complete: it involved <u>a formulation of the marginalist principle in economic analysis</u>. Hence, this theory was crucial for the successive rise of the [[Marginalist School]].

Ricardo’s theory is formulated on the following assumptions:
1. [[Jean-Baptiste Say#Say’s Law|Say’s Law]] applies: there is no shortage of demand
2. The capital left over in the production process is made of wages anticipated to workers from capitalists
