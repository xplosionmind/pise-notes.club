[David Ricardo] (1772-1823) was an English economist, one of the greatest exponents of the Classical School. During his life, he grew interested in the economic situation of his country. In particular, he focused his attention on the debate concerning **Corn Laws**, which caused a continental block and during the Napoleonic wars opposite ideas about his suppression or prosecution emerged.\
Ricardo was in favor of abolishing duties since they would have increased the price of grain; a rise in the price of wheat would increase both rents and wages, and reduce profits.

## Theory of rent and diminishing returns

Elaborated in response to the Corn Law debate, this theory was first discovered by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], but Ricardo made it clearer and more complete: it involved <u>a formulation of the marginalist principle in economic analysis</u>. Hence, this theory was crucial for the successive rise of the [[Marginalist School]].

Ricardo’s theory is formulated on the following assumptions:

1. [[Jean-Baptiste Say#Say’s Law|Say’s Law]] applies: there is no shortage of demand
2. The capital left over in the production process is made of wages anticipated to workers from capitalists
3. Wages are the minimum for subsistence (see [[Thomas Robert Malthus#Population|Malthus’ Population Theory]])
4. Wages are composed exclusively by grain
5. In the agricultural sector, techniques of production are given and do not change

### Agricultural sector

Given these assumptions, agriculture is the only productive sector in which outputs equal inputs, in the form of the same commodity, grain. Surplus is hence <u>measured in physical terms</u>, without introducing any relative price.

<b class="center" id="formula-1">Formula 1:</b>

$$
\pi_g = \frac{Y_g - L_g \cdot w}{L_g \cdot w} = \frac{\frac{Y_g}{L_g} - w}{w} = \frac{Pr_g - w}{w}
$$

where:

- $\pi_g$:= profit rate;
- $L_g$:= labor employed in the cultivation of grain;
- $L_g \cdot w$:= circulating capital employed in grain production;
- $Y_g - L_g \cdot w$:= surplus, grain net product;
- $Pr_g = \frac{Y_g}{L_g}$:= labor productivity in agriculture;
- $w$:= wages (calculated as amount of grain).

It follows that the profit rate varies…

- …directly with productivity changes
- …indirectly with real wages

### Non-agricultural sectors

In non-agricultural sectors, products and their means of production are different commodities, it is therefore necessary to introduce relative prices in measurements. Furthermore, since wages are expected in terms of grain, there needs to be a tool to convert the value of the products coming from some sector to quantity of grain.

Taking the textile sector as an example, it is sufficient to multiply the circulating capital ($L_g \cdot w$) by $p_{c/g} = \frac{p_c}{p_g} = \frac{1}{p_{g/c}}$:= price of one unit of grain in terms of clothing:

$$
\pi_c = \frac{Y_c - L_c \cdot w \cdot p_{c/g}}{L_c - w \cdot p_{c/g}} = \ldots = \frac{Pr_{c} \cdot w - p_{c/g}}{w \cdot p_{c/g}}
$$

$$
\pi_c = \frac{Y_c \cdot p_{g/c} - L_c \cdot w}{L_c \cdot w} = \ldots = \frac{Pr_{c;g} \cdot p_{g/c} -w}{w}
$$
