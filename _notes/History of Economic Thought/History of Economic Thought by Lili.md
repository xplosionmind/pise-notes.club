Introduction

Many people believe that the economy is solely related to money/efficiency, or investments/time. However, this is a common misconception: <u>many economists disagree on many aspects, and this increases the confusion regarding the definition of economy itself</u>.

But we can delineate two main definitions:

THE “MAINSTREAM” DEFINITION (ME)

Economy is <u>the science studying human behaviour as the relationship between man-power and scarce means</u>. The object of economics is the behaviour of individuals; in general, an economic agent has limited resources, implying that the economic problem faced by these agents is how to make the best use of limited resources. Their choices are based on what we call a rationality criterion, meaning that everyone is able to compare costs and benefits following a set of alternative scenarios. Typically, an individual maximises its benefits and minimises its losses. <u>Society is the aggregation of these individual behaviours</u>.

THE HETERODOX DEFINITION (HE)

<u>Economics is the study of social economic activities that generate an array of surplus needed to sustain social individuals and society as a whole</u>. From this point of view, social economic activity is something related to a constant process of change (e.g.: production activity depends on a specific historical time period, and this process might change over time). <u>Economic activities are interlinked with other aspects, such as religion, social culture, etc</u>.

Given the pros and cons of each definition, <u>we can say that the heterodox definition is preferable due to its dynamic nature that successfully adapts to different historical periods</u>. Different schools of thought might use the same method, but focusing on different topics.

There are three main schools of thought:

ANCIENT SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS

These schools have had an impact in past centuries, but with cultural, economic and social evolution they are no longer present. The Scholastic school represented the prevailing branch of thought during western medieval society, when Catholic Church represented the highest earthly power (in terms of wealth and land) and spiritual power.

With the decline of the European feudal system and the emergence of nation-states, the Mercantilist theory conquered the scene. Although European countries were steeped in mercantilist economic policies, an alternative view was represented by Physiocrats which focused on the development of agricultural sector as the only way to increase the productivity of a State.

OLD SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

This school of thought is still quite influential because it deeply influences the scholars of our period. It includes the following schools of thought:

Classical (Smith, Ricardo) = investigates economic development

Neoclassical = studies the rational decisions of single agents

Historical/institutional (Weber) = studies the evolution of society

Keynesian = studies uncertainty, the business cycle, and demand-oriented policy

MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS’ APPROACH

Austrian school = studies the business cycle

Marxist approach = considered a member of the classical school, Marx focused on the criticism of capitalism by using the same approach as classical school

Methodology

In economics, we use two different methods to analyse certain aspects of economics. The parts of a method are:

PHENOMENON

A phenomenon is a fact/event observed in reality; if a fact can be observed, we are able to explain it.

THEORY

A theory is the explanation of one or more phenomena and is an interpretation that a scholar gives to a particular phenomenon. Explanation power is the range of phenomena that a theory is able to explain. The domain of a theory, on the other hand, is the portion of reality within which the theory works. The portion is defined by time and space.

The definition of a theory in terms of time and space is crucial in order to understand the methods used by different schools.

MODEL

This is an instrument used to synthesise a theory (e.g.: a humanistic model (verbal discussion) or a graphical representation of a theory).

The two methods in question are:

THE HYPOTHETICAL DEDUCTIVE METHOD

This is <u>the method of developing a theory through given premises or assumption</u>. It involves the process of reasoning from certain laws or principles, which are assumed to be true, to the analysis of facts. Then inferences are drawn which are verified against observed facts.

Fundamentally, <u>the deductive method involves reasoning from a few fundamental propositions, the truth of which is assumed</u>. The steps in this method are.

Make initial assumptions that are generally accepted as true

Form a second premise that is related to it

Conduct testing

Come to a conclusion

In the hypothetical deductive method, premises are abstract statements formulated without observing the reality of the world (hypothetical-deductive method)

Deductive methods, however, also have drawbacks. <u>The general conclusions are valid only if the general statements/premises are true as well (and vice versa)</u>. This approach is not only time invariant, but also space invariant, so they don’t change over time. If something changes in the premises, we are unable to handle it. Another possible drawback is that <u>the general assumptions may be too general, and thus the theory might lead to a conclusion that is unable to explain an important part of reality</u>.

The schools belonging to this method are:

<u>The Scholastic school</u> (uses Christianity to reach conclusions)

<u>Physiocracy</u> (supposes that agriculture is the only source of surplus)

<u>Neoclassical school/Austrian school</u> (supposes that individuals are rational and reaches conclusions on the basis of this belief; can be divided according to the model used, AKA, mathematical, which pertains to the neoclassical school, or verbal, pertaining to the Austrian school) —&gt; what we use

THE HISTORICAL DEDUCTIVE METHOD

This is similar to the above method, except that premises are defined by observing historical facts (the historical deductive method).

The schools belonging to this method are:

<u>The Classical/Marxist school</u> (bases its conclusions on the observation of social and economic facts)

<u>Keynesian schools</u> (bases its conclusions on the fact that the economic cycle is actually demand-driven)

<u>Evolutionary economy</u> (bases its conclusions on the fact that growth is driven by endogenous innovations)

THE INDUCTIVE METHOD

While the deductive method is based on very general assumptions that lead to a particular conclusion, the inductive method starts from a particular assumption that leads to a general conclusion through empirical experiments. This method derives economic generalisations on the basis of:

Experimentations

Observations

Statistical methods

This method, however, can be quite expensive because a lot of data is needed to reach a general conclusion. Finally, another drawback is the result might be misinterpreted due to the difficulty of analysing results.

The schools belonging to this method are:

<u>William Petty’s school</u> (bases its conclusions on the fact that economics is based on numbers)

<u>Historical/institutional school</u> (bases its conclusions on the experiences of a country)

A mixed approach also exists:

MERCANTILISM

With mercantilism, we reach conclusions through both general and minor premises.

The importance of understanding different approaches lies in the fact that this enables us to differentiate the different definitions of economics given by schools of thought:

<u>Neoclassical school + Hypothetical-deductive mainstream economics</u> = economics is an abstract subject, and time and space are invariant

<u>Classical/Marxist schools + Historical-deductive heterodox economics</u> = economics changes over time, but principles are applicable everywhere; space is invariant, and time is variant

<u>Historical/Institutional schools + William Petty’s inductive school</u> = economics changes over time and space, and thus these last two are variant

<u>Mercantilist hypothetical-deductive method/historical-deductive method</u> = minor premises change over time

Moreover, the view of history of economic thought these schools have depends on the approach used:

<u>ME (mainstream approach):</u> economics is based on universal laws like a physical science; in this case, studying the history of economic thought is useless

<u>HE (heterodox approach):</u> economics is based on evolving principles like a social science; in this case, studying the history of economic thought helps to interpret these changes

But why is it important to study the history of economics? Because:

It grants us the ability to develop general and cognitive skills, namely, the ability to understand and interpret real-life events

It grants us the ability to understand the concepts of economics and its evolution

It grants us the ability to understand how economics is intertwined with other disciplines

The Evolution of Economic Concepts

In order to understand each school’s contribution to economics, it is necessary that we analyse the development of economic concepts and <u>the evolution of the economic system</u>. This evolution can be broken down into four distinct phases.

<u>PRIMITIVE HUNTER-GATHERER SOCIETIES (2 mil. years ago - 799 B.C.)</u>

Individuals’ main objective was to survive, and thus there was no room for the birth of an economy. <u>What actually triggered the development of an economic society was the discovery of agriculture and breeding, which lead to a different organisation of society.</u> Settlements came into being in territories we now know as Egypt, India, and China.

<u>SLAVE-BASED ECONOMIES (800 B.C. - 476 A.D.)</u>

The Ancient Greek and Roman Empires can be considered the main components of these types of economies; but <u>while the Greek Empire was based on small and self-sufficient city-states, Rome formed a big state that needed to handle everything through functionaries, taxation, etc.</u>

Nonetheless, both Empires were hierarchically organised:

Government

Military

Slaves

Major thinkers had long committed themselves to discovering what conditions made it possible to preserve such an order. This order, however, did not last: the Roman Empire collapsed at the end of this era.

<u>FEUDALISM (476 A.D. - 1500)</u>

In this era, trade was interrupted and society had the need to reorganise itself. It did so by centring its economy around manors (lands controlled by landlords and cultivated by serfs, who are actually quite different from slaves). <u>Serfs actually worked according to a contract they sign with the landlord, who, in return for their manual labour, provided them with prime necessities.</u> This is very different form slave labour, where slaves are exploited and never repaid.

In this era, society’s organisation remains hierarchical:

God + Jesus

King

Landlords

Serfs

<u>The problem with feudal economies, however, is that they are self-sufficient; all economical life is contained within the confines of each manor, and this leaves no space for trade or innovation.</u> Towns and settlements are inhabited by artisans who produced manufactured goods, and activities within these towns are managed by guilds. These are artisans who reunite in unions who produce the same good and set the quality of it.

Given these factors, it becomes apparent that towns were where trade principally happened. Some of it can also occur among manors, but the nature of this trade is limited to agricultural products.

<u>The breaking point of feudal society was the discovery of new lands and the opening of opportunities for kings and landlords to embrace the increase in nations’ wealth that happened around this time due to a steady inflow of gold and silver.</u>

<u>MERCANTILISM (1500’)</u>

This era marks the passage from a closed system to a new, open system. Kings started organising trade networks with merchants, who starred as one of the most important figures in economics during this period. <u>Financial resources were funded by royal families, while it was up to merchants to bring the economic field to life.</u>

The most powerful nation-states in this period were Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and France. <u>These nation-states all competed for new lands in order to be the “early birds” and obtain as many precious raw materials as possible.</u> Wealth corresponded to the quantity of gold and silver possessed by these nation-states and was the principal source of military power (by means of which conquest was possible).

Given these analytical elements, we can see how changes in views about the effects of gold on the economy can be justified:

MORE GOLD &gt; INCREASE IN OUTPUT —&gt; GOLD AFFECTS THE ECONOMY

MORE MONEY &gt; INCREASE IN PRICES —&gt; GOLD DOESN’T AFFECT THE ECONOMY

This period also features the birth of cottage industries; some merchants invested their profit made by trade in these centres of rudimental manufacturing activity, where things such as textile goods were produced. These were the first forms of capital firms, where means of production were rudimental.

<u>CAPITALISM (1750’S - TODAY)</u>

This system evolved from the “cottage-industry” model. In fact, the latter attracted the interest of the nobility, who invested in the technological development of the means of production. <u>New, expensive machinery was introduced, and its costs drove owners to seek profits to cover them.</u>

In the first year of “capitalism”, entrepreneurs’ hunger for profit actually resulted in the exploitation of workers. This was later referred to as the dark age of capitalism, or “industrial capitalism”.

Capitalism can actually be divided into other sub-eras:

INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM (1750’s-1850’s)

Entrepreneurs’ hunger for profit resulted in the exploitation of workers.

FINANCIAL CAPITALISM (1900’s - 1980’s)

In this era, the function of capitalism was based on the financial sector. Because machinery was expensive, entrepreneurs depended on banks to acquire loans and afford them.

For this reason, banks became more relevant in this period. Moreover, the financial market developed with the rise of a middle class, whose savings flowed into investments in the financial market itself.

GLOBAL CAPITALISM (1980’s - today)

This phase is characterised by intense interaction among different countries, which is a key factor in their economic development. Nonetheless, this connection is also fundamental for the understanding of crises, whose spread is known as the “spillover effect”.

In analysing these three stages of capitalism, it must be noted that there are different levels of complexity (which are related to different intellectual contributions) to accompany each stage:

LOWEST LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

The intellectual contribution of this level are Marx’s main ideas.

MIDDLE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

Keynesian ideas can be found at this level.

HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

Diverse contributions characterise this level.

Scholasticism and the Pre-Classical School

<u>SCHOLASTICISM</u>

Scholasticism is a school of thought which developed during feudalism and can be dated back to the period of time between the <u>12th</u> and the <u>16th century</u>. Scholastic thought was deeply influenced by Christianity, as, by means of the hypothetical-deductive method, it formulated conclusions on the basis of Christian beliefs, regarded as principles of natural law.

One of the greatest exponents of this school was Thomas Aquinas, whose contribution can be summarised in two points:

JUST PRICE

Natural price determined by the forces of the market.

USURY

The borrowing of money in exchange for money; it is an unnatural use, since money here is a medium of exchange

During feudalism, the clergy was actually the class with the biggest accumulations of wealth (a fact that clashes greatly with the pinnacles of Christian faith).

<u>PRE-CLASSICAL SCHOOL</u>

The pre-classical school was most active between the <u>1400’s</u> and the <u>1800’s</u> and encompassed two other major schools of thought we mentioned before:

MERCANTILISM (William Petty)

PHYSIOCRACY (François Quesnay)

The ideas formulated by these schools were related to a market-based economy and to a period of time characterised by the growing influence of empiricism and the inductive approach. The most important among the empiricists was Francis Bacon, whose views greatly influenced William Petty.

<u>MERCANTILISM</u>

The mercantilist school of thought came into being as an <u>attempt to elaborate policy proposals and increase wealth and power</u>, which was ultimately based on the accumulation of gold and silver.

For this reason, merchants themselves were the <u>main vehicles of trade and economic activity</u> within this school off thought. They generally indicated trade (inflow of gold and silver from colonies and the export of goods) as the key to economic wealth.

Mercantilism can be divided into two distinct periods:

1500’S - 1650’S

In this era, it was widely believed that the import of gold and silver to a country from its colonies determined the increase in prices. This occurred by means of a mechanism called the quantity theory of money, elaborated by Jean Bodin and expressed by a simple equation:

M x V = P x Y

Where:

M x V = expense capacity

P x Y = nominal level of output

M = money made with gold and silver

V = velocity of circulation of money (average number of transactions); this is fixed because it depends on peoples’ habits

P = price

Y = output

Velocity and output can be considered as fixed quantities, and therefore an increase in money results in an increase in price.

1650’S - 1750’S

In this period, raging conflicts cause a reduction in imports of silver and gold. In order to restore equilibrium, the export of goods increases, resulting in the production of money. This can be explained by a re-elaboration of the quantity theory of money by John Law and William Petty:

M x V = P x Y

Where:

V is fixed

Y increases in order to support exports

P is law

M increases

William Petty (1623 - 1687)

William Petty was an English mercantilist and the founder of political arithmetic, <u>a method consisting of the application of quantitative methods to the analysis of social and economic phenomena</u>. The novelty of this method reflected the innovation occurring at that time, especially in the field of quantitative science.

Petty was greatly influenced by Francis Bacon’s inductive method, and he was fascinated by experimental science (empirical). <u>Petty’s method is, in fact, based on induction from quantitative data and thus empirical research.</u>

He acknowledged, however, that scientific experimentation was complex and hard to apply to social notions. Moreover, he wasn’t a naive supporter of the inductive method: <u>in his view, deduction is relevant, and, for this reason, a large part of his analysis is conducted by means of the hypothetical-deductive method.</u>

Petty’s main contribution to the study of economics concerns:

LABOUR-THEORY OF VALUE

Petty firstly explained the concept of value. From his point of view, the value of goods tends to fluctuate around a central value called natural value, which <u>corresponds to the costs of production (the amount of labour and land employed in the production process)</u>.

Pa, t = Lt + Tt + Vt

Where:

Pa, t = value of a good “a” at time “t”

Lt = labour employed at time “t”

Tt = land employed at time “t”

Vt = quantity of inputs (different from L, T) employed at time “t”

Assuming that Vt results from one year of production with the use of Lt-1 and Tt and Vt-1, the formula becomes:

Pa, t = Lt + Tt + Lt-1 + Tt-1 + Vt-1

If we keep substituting for Vt-2, Vt-3, etc., and Vt-n and n is large enough, it becomes plausible that Vt-n ~ O:

Pa, t = Σ ↑ (n) ↓ (j=o) x (Lt-j) + Σ ↑ (n) ↓ (j=o) x Tt - j

There are two problems with this approach:

Petty was never able to classify what the convergence mechanism is about.

It doesn’t allow us to compare two different goods in terms of their exchange value, since a proper unit of measurement would require us to use one single magnitude (either land or labour); Petty didn’t manage to find a way to convert land into labour, and vice-versa.

DIVISION OF LABOUR

Petty believed that <u>society is a complex organism where different groups of workers have different roles in order to ensure the functionality and survival of this society.</u> According to him, these roles were organised hierarchically on the basis of the kind of goods produced.

The highest position was occupied by labourers in the agricultural sector, since Petty believed that <u>this was the only sector capable of producing enough surplus to support the entire society.</u> The key role of agriculture was indirectly proven by the existence of rent.

Moreover, <u>Petty introduced a technical division on a firm-level with the idea that an efficient organisation within firms could improve labour productivity.</u> Petty could be considered a forerunner of Adam Smith’s main ideas.

FOREIGN TRADE

Petty’s views about international trade developed during an age of mature mercantilism, characterised by a <u>sudden reduction in the inflow of precious metals from the colonies.</u> This suggests that the only way to increase the wealth of nations in monetary terms was to favour exports. Such a view was represented by the new quantity theory of money.

FISCAL ASPECTS

Petty proposed the introduction of proportional taxation based on individual consumption. The fairness of this criterion was proven by two main points:

It couldn’t alter the distribution of income

It avoided double-taxation (income taxes paid twice on the same source of income; occurs when income is taxed both at a corporate level and at a personal level)

MONEY

Petty established a connection between investment expenditures and interest rates, with the former being negatively affected by the level of the latter; <u>a higher interest rate resulted in a merchant’s higher cost of investment. Petty thought, however, that a larger stock of money means a lower interest rate</u>.

Physiocracy

The physiocrats were a <u>very compact and combative group of French economists whose major exponent was François Quesnay</u>, author of the “Tableau économique”, a text that forearm the tables used by post-Keynesian thinkers, and the concept of general equilibrium, elaborated by the Neoclassical school.

The term “physiocracy” comes from the greek φύσις + κράτος, meaning “the power of nature”; this etymological significance suggests the importance of agriculture as an economic activity in physiocratic thought.

Nonetheless, the contribution of physiocrats can only be understood if we study the historical context in the years it came into being.

In the <u>mid-18th century</u>, France suffered from inefficient taxation, obsolete production techniques, and a deeply feudal economic organisation; Britain, on the other hand, was the greatest economic power at the time.

<u>What physiocrats wanted to do was help France exit this crises and reach growth levels similar to what Britain had</u>. In order to do so, these thinkers came up with various talking points that could help France in this endeavour, and in this way, made major contributions to economic studies:

INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

<u>Since agriculture was considered to be the only sector capable of producing a surplus, physiocrats attributed a key role to its development</u>. This was only possible by means of advanced farming techniques, which, according to Quesnay, facilitated mass cultivation.

Given that only an appropriate stock of capital guarantees the productivity of agriculture, the problem France’s low productivity rate derived from investment deficits and capital (particularly fixed agricultural capital). <u>These are only possible if a price system exists and enables farmers to obtain profit and invest it in tools and machinery</u>.

PRICING IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

Quesnay traced a key distinction between fundamental price and market price:

<u>FUNDAMENTAL PRICE</u>

This is the price that covers all the production costs. In the case of a farmer, it is equal to:

Pg \[(Wg + Mg) + Sk\] + R

Meaning that the price of an agricultural good is equal to:

Wg = wages of the workers employed

Mg = value of the raw materials employed

Sk = proportion of the capital consumed

R = annual rent paid to landowners

<u>MARKET PRICE</u>

This is the price observed in the market. The farmers will only obtain profits if Pv - Pg &gt; 0.

Quesnay actually feared low levels of Pv in France and its sizeable oscillations, which were seen as very damaging since they discouraged farmers from long-term investments in fixed capital.

TABLEU ÉCONOMIQUE

Quesnay’s tableau économique is the best-known heritage left by the physiocrats. <u>Published in several versions, it was considered to be a forerunner of Marx’s schemes of reproduction, input-output analysis, modern national accounting systems, multiplier analysis, and general equilibrium analysis.</u>

The table aimed at showing the conditions that must be fulfilled to ensure the reproduction of the economy.

<u>ANALYSIS</u>

According to the tableau, society is divided into three classes/sectors:

LANDOWNERS

Live off of the surplus obtained by the productive class.

PRODUCTIVE SECTOR

This sector needs a quantity of agricultural and manufactured goods in order to produce. It is productive because it produces a net product, which = surplus.

MANUFACTURING SECTOR

Needs a quantity of agricultural gods to produced manufactured goods. Within the sterile class, the value of inputs = value of output.

In the case below, T represents the time in which the analysis starts and corresponds to the end of the previous productive cycle. Here, output equals 5 billion in agriculture and 2 billion in manufacturing. <u>Money (2 billion) is in the hands of the agricultural sector. At the end of one cycle, the same situation reoccurs, demonstrating the fact that the economy produced itself.</u>

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:3.10235in;height:1.08117in" /><img src="media/image2.png" style="width:2.50438in;height:4.14977in" />

<img src="media/image3.png" style="width:2.82054in;height:4.27859in" />

Several points should be emphasised:

REPRODUCTION

The 2 billion have returned to the farmers, and agriculture and manufacturing have both recovered, enabling a new cycle to begin.

NET PRODUCT AND TAXES

The surplus (what remains of one product once the means of production and subsistence of the workers in the economy have been reproduced) corresponds

INTERCONNECTIONS

Every class is connected to all the others, and thus the process of exchanges allows the redistribution of resources, which, in turn, enables the sectors to reintegrate the initial endowments of means

Classical Economic Thought

Classical economics (also referred to as political economy) represents <u>18th/19th-century</u> mainstream economics. The Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (<u>1723 - 1790</u>) is generally considered to be the founder of this school. Other important figures are Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo. It is also possible to include Karl Marx in this group, as he used the analytical tools typical of classical schools (although he criticised them).

These authors lived during an age of industrial capitalism (<u>1750’s - 1900’s</u>), characterised by the use of very expensive machinery. In order to invest in it and hire workers, the entrepreneur’s primary focus during this period is profit. <u>The money invested (M) in machinery and workers, who produce a given commodity (C), is a smaller sum than the final value (M’)</u>:

M —&gt; C —&gt; M’

The uncertainty regarding the possibility of obtaining M’ &gt; M leads to the exploitation of workers and, together with the increase in population during those years, resulted in incredibly low wages. Such conditions created the background for the development of classical economic theories. In particular, classical economists shared some basic ideas:

An interest in growth and development, which they thought would culminate in a stationary state, where the economy would just reproduce itself, resulting in zero growth (this is a pessimistic view regarding the capacity of capitalism in guaranteeing growth in the long-run)

The concentration on the cost of production is the main determinant of price, and thus the value of goods should correspond to the cost sustained by entrepreneurs

There is considerable concern regarding the distribution of income between labour, land, and capital in the form of wages, rents and profits

Adam Smith (1723-1790)

Smith was born in <u>1723</u> in Scotland. In University, he came under the influence of Francis Hutcheson, who gave lectures on economic issues and who brought Smith into contact with the philosopher David Hume. The main economic ideas developed by Smith can be summarised in:

<u>MOTIVATIONS OF HUMAN ACTIONS</u>

The motivations for human actions are fundamental for Smith’s view of economy, which was heavily influenced by Hutcheson’s idea that all men are not purely self-interested. <u>Specifically, Smith believed that the proper functioning of society depended on self-interest and moral rules: men are guided by self-interest, which is moderated by sympathy for other people’s interests (the ability to share their feelings).</u>

As a consequence, each action is evaluated on the basis of its effect on other individuals. There are two kinds of sympathy:

APPROVAL BY ACTUAL PEOPLE

Approval by people closer to the daily life of an individual.

APPROVAL BY COMMUNITY

Approval by people belonging to the same community as an individual.

<u>THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT</u>

The mitigation of self-interest, which links the pursuit of individual desires and the social benefit, is all at the core of Smith’s notion of the Invisible Hand: <u>competitive market exchanges inspired by self-interest and moral rules are the invisible force which guarantees social well-being.</u>

It must be noted that, according to Smith, the pursuit of mitigated self-interests frequently promotes social benefits, but this is not necessarily the case. In fact, when “natural liberty” (freedom of action) is in conflict with the interests of society as a whole, it must be limited through judicial means.

Smith believed that the government is effective in:

Guaranteeing national defence

Administrating justice

Subsidising mass education

Undertaking public endeavours when they are socially beneficial and privately unprofitable

<u>Nonetheless, Smith is sceptical regarding the role of governments in economic decisions, and thus he distances himself from mercantilism, according to which kings decisively contribute to trade</u>; for Smith, this causes an ineffective allocation of resources.

For these reasons, Smith could be considered a supporter of laissez-faire economics.

<u>DETERMINANTS OF NATIONAL WEALTH</u>

One of the crucial objectives of economics for Smith is <u>the study of the nature and causes of the wealth of nations</u>. He identifies this wealth as per capita income, which depends on two major factors:

The productivity of employees in the production process

The share of citizens employed in the production process

Aka:

(y/N) = (L/N) x Pr

Where:

y/N = per capita income

Pr = productivity

Per capita income ultimately <u>depends on the share of citizens employed in productive activity and on the productivity of employees</u> (which depends on division of labour and the size of markets). The division of labour is particularly efficient when we want to maximise production, but this division can only occur in large markets (<u>the size of a market depends on the level of liberal policies introduced by public authorities and the level of development of transports/communications</u>).

Smith believes that the introduction of policies aiming at the elimination of the obstacles to free trade and to the favour of market expansion may set a process into motion:

THE EXPANSION OF MARKETS —&gt; INCREASED DIVISION OF LABOUR —&gt; INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY —&gt; INCREASED PER CAPITA INCOME —&gt; FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE MARKET

Smith also makes a fundamental distinction between:

PRODUCTIVE LABOUR (L)

Employed in the production of goods

UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR

Employed in the provision of services

Since the latter is not essential for economic growth, <u>the percentage of workers employed in services should be minimised.</u>

Moreover, it should be taken into account that L/N depends on:

Institutional elements and customs (e.g.: laws on education

The stage reached by the process of accumulation (the productive utilisation of the surplus resulted from the economy, and it can include investments in new means for production or subsistence for additional productive workers)

Ultimately, <u>Smith emphasises the side effects of fragmented labour, and especially its ability to reduce the cognitive skills of workers, despite their native intelligence.</u> Nonetheless, the positive effects of the division of labour overcome the negative ones.

<u>ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STATIONARY ECONOMICS</u>

<u>The division of labour undoubtedly results in a rapid increase in productivity, which, in turn, leads to the growth of the economy</u>. This, however, brings about two relevant interrelated questions:

What is the element that forces society into the continuous division of labour and economic growth?

Smith believes that the answer lies in all of society’s insatiable desire to better itself which, in a modern economy, consists of the desire to increase entrepreneurs’ proper revenue. <u>This pushes them to invest in new machinery, which allows for a finer division of labour, and thus an increase in productivity and economic growth.</u> Because of competition, the profit rates obtained in different branches should be equal or should tend towards equality.

How do we know that this tendency towards growth will continue and won’t come to an abrupt stop?

Smith claims that the increase of profit should encounter a limit; c<u>ompetition tends to reduce profit rate, which is total profit expressed as a percentage of invested capital in the production process.</u>

This sentence can be misleading, since in Smith’s previous analysis there seemed to not be any space for the decrease of profit rates; if the accumulation of capital produces an increase in productivity, why should profit rates decrease as surplus increases?

Given the general tone of his written pieces, it might seem as if Smith is optimistic regarding the capability of accumulation to make the economy grow and counteract the fall in profit rates.

<u>DIVISION OF SOCIAL CLASSES</u>

The role of social classes is fundamental in Smith’s theory of economic growth and capital accumulation. <u>In his view, society (which reflects the typical capitalistic one of his time) is divided into three classes,</u> each with its own kind of income:

WORKERS

They receive wages as their income, which are pushed to a subsistent level by:

Capitalists’ ability to influence laws regarding workers

Workers’ competition on the labour market

Workers don’t contribute to the wealth of the nation, even if they contribute to the production of it.

CAPITALISTS

Their income is classified as “profits”. They own productive capital and have great interest in maximising it, and thus their propensity towards capital accumulation is crucial in promoting economic growth and increasing the wealth of nations.

<u>Since workers’ wages are at the subsistence level, capitalists’ income is equal to the surplus produced within the economy</u>. Specifically, the higher the share of surplus which goes to profits, the higher the rate of growth of the wealth of the nation.

LANDLORDS/LANDOWNERS

They own the land and receive rent as income; they don’t own capital and don’t have any incentive to accumulate it and contribute to the growth of the wealth of a nation.

It is crucial to emphasise that <u>agricultural activities are not the only ones to produce surplus in Adam Smith’s theory</u>: this surplus can also be obtained through any productive activity, particularly in the industry sector. It’s the result of human labour, and what interests economists is the problem of how surplus can be measured and how it is distributed throughout social classes. These issues are later addressed by the theory of value.

<u>THE THEORY OF VALUE</u>

<u>The theory of value is one of Smith’s central contributions (and also that of other classical economists) because it forms the basis of the functioning of an economic system divided in social classes and sectors.</u>

Let’s consider a simple economy composed of one agricultural sector and by two classes: workers and farmers. Let’s also suppose that, to produce a certain amount of grain (Xg), the farmer uses seeds (s) and labour (L):

Xg = f(s ; L)

<u>The two social classes exchange goods and services in order to ensure the functioning of the economic system</u>; farmers have to buy labour from the workers (input) and the workers have to buy grain from farmers (subsistence). The value of grain must be such as to guarantee (i) a profit to the farmer to restore the seeds consumed in the production process and (ii) the purchase of subsistence goods for the workers.

Many other examples can be made, but the point is the same: <u>the theory of value (the study of how goods are priced) is a theory explaining the exchange relationships among classes and sectors that guarantee the functioning of the economic system.</u>

According to this framework, Smith distinguishes between:

VALUE IN USE

Reflects the utility coming from the ownership of a given good.

VALUE IN EXCHANGE

This is the power of a commodity to purchase other goods and is the measure observed in the market. There are two sub-groups that the price in values of exchange can be divided into:

<u>MARKET PRICE</u>

This is the price observed in the market in a certain period, and is determined by demand and supply.

<u>NATURAL PRICE</u>

This is the theoretical price corresponding to the reproduction conditions of the economic system; in other words, it is the price enabling workers to survive and firms to obtain sufficient profit to continue production in the future. Natural price can be measured in many ways, neither of which will lead Smith to satisfactory results:

<u>LABOUR EMBODIED (LE)</u>

The value of a commodity corresponds to the quantity of labour required for its production.

<u>LABOUR COMMANDED (LC)</u>

The value of a commodity is equal to the quantity of labour needed to obtain a salary (w) corresponding to the value (p) of the commodity itself (i.e., LE = p/w).

<u>ADDING-UP-THEORY (AU)</u>

The value of a commodity is equal to the sum of rents, wages, and profits. The problem is that this theory doesn’t work in absence of sales revenues determination and budget constraints among income components.

Under the condition that the demand for a particular good equals the optimal supply, natural price (p^n) corresponds to market price (p^t), so:

P^n = P^t

Moreover, <u>Smith claims that this condition doesn’t often prove to be true because the economy is continually hit by supply and demand shocks.</u> Thus, the market price keeps fluctuating around the natural price.

Regardless of the nature of the shock, fluctuations arise on the demand side, and are reabsorbed by the supply side through the competition mechanism.

Post-Smithian Classical Schools

The period of time between Smith and Ricardo was a transitional phase characterised by relevant changes both in the main economic themes and in the way of analysing them.

During the French Revolution, the need to introduce increasingly liberal policies arose. The following year was characterised by <u>numerous crises in the agricultural sector</u> and in employment, especially in Great Britain. This is why issues related to crises and laissez-faire are at the core of post-Smithian classical scholars’ theories.

Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832)

Jean-Baptiste Say was a French economist, and his main contributions were:

THE THEORY OF VALUE

Say’s concept of value was at odds with Smith’s, and thus <u>Say maintained a subjective utility theory of value, where the basis for value is utility rather than a labour theory of value.</u>

The value of a commodity and its production, according to Say, depends on how potential consumers evaluate it. <u>Therefore, the prices of goods and services reflect their utility to buyers.</u> In such a frame, costs of production don’t determine market price — they could, at most, fix the lower level of prices. The monetary value of a commodity is defined by Say as “current price”.

INCOME DISTRIBUTION

For Say, <u>labour, capital, and land are the three types of productive services required for the production of goods</u>. Their use in production must be compensated for by their availability to be employed during the process.

<u>The remuneration of the final good equals the one of the production factors</u>, and thus the value of output independently determined in the market goes entirely to the owner of the means of production.

SAY’S LAW

The acknowledgement of Say’s theory on income distribution is crucial for understanding Say’s law: <u>the sum of all distributed revenues is equal to that of the value of total output.</u>

In other words, to produce a good means to create a demand of equal value through the revenues of the owner of the three production factors. This is valid only on the basis of the following assumption:

“People spend all their money insofar as they’re not interested in accumulating money. People produce commodities to sell them to earn money; nobody wants to hold on to money because it falls in value, so people swap money for the other products they want. Thus, supply creates its own demand.”

<u>One of the consequences of Say’s law is that, if supply creates demand, there is no space for overproduction in the economy as a whole.</u> This way, Smith’s liberalism is overcome: market forces always lead to equilibrium and the government is not attributed any role in the correction of sectoral imbalances.

<u>Say’s law has always been at the core of the conflict between classical and Keynesian economists, because for classical economists, supply is the most important sector in the economy to achieve growth, whereas for Keynesian economists, demand is the most important sector to achieve growth</u>.

Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834)

Malthus was an English economist, philosopher, and demographer. His main contributions concerned:

POPULATION

Malthus’ claim was that population growth dooms society to poverty. This is the result of two distinct processes:

ARITHMETIC GROWTH OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION

Results from the presence of diminishing returns (according to the law of diminishing returns, less output is added as more people work on the same amount of land) and limits in available lands.

GEOMETRIC GROWTH OF THE POPULATION

This is the result of the human sex drive. According to Malthus, population growth can be checked in two main ways:

<u>PREVENTIVE CHECKS</u>

These reduce birth rate by means of moral restraints such as family planning, late marriages, and celibacy.

<u>POSITIVE CHECKS</u>

These increase the death rate. These restrictions arise naturally when population increases; some examples are natural disasters, such as pandemics.

<u>If none of these checks work, then the population might enter a phase of hunger and misery, as food won’t be enough for everyone.</u> Since Malthus considers poverty and misery natural population checkers, he believes that peoples’ failure to retain their reproduction should not be met with governmental policies aimed at supporting the poor. This would only encourage early marriage with new unfortunate births.

WAGES AND RENTS

THEORY OF MARKET GLUTS

David Ricardo (1772-1823)

David Ricardo was an English economist and one of the greatest exponents of the classical school of thought. During his life, he was very attentive towards the economic situation of his country.

One of the elements that played a huge part in his economic theories was the debate on Corn Laws. <u>The latter caused a continental block, and during the Napoleonic wars, this produced sharp increases in the price of grain in England.</u> After the Napoleonic wears, a debate arose within the country on whether or not maintain these laws that blocked imports of grain. <u>Ricardo was in favour of the abolition of this law due to the rising prices of grain, which would then increase wages and rent and reduce profits.</u>

Ricardo’s ideas, together with their logical construction, owe very much to Malthus’ theories. In particular, Ricardo’s contributions concern:

<u>THE THEORY OF RENT AND DIMINISHING RETURNS</u>

This theory was elaborated in response to the debate regarding the Corn Law. <u>Although Malthus’ theory was the original one, Ricardo’s re-elaboration of it was clearer and more complete and involved a formulation of the marginalise principle in economic analysis.</u>

His theory of rent, therefore, was crucial to the later rise of the marginalise school.

Ricardo’s analysis is based on the following assumptions:

Say’s law is valid

In the production process, “circulating capital” is advanced (wages)

Wages satisfy workers at a subsistent level

The level of wages are indicative of the price of grain

In non-agricultural sectors, techniques of production do not change and are rather given

On the basis of these assumptions, <u>agriculture is the only productive sector in which output equals input, and thus they are the same commodity: grain</u>. This means that surplus is measured in physical terms, without the need to use relative prices.

Ricardo defines the rate of profits πg as:

πg = (Prg - W)/(W)

Where:

Prg = Yg/Lg, which indicates labour productivity in agriculture

W = wages in terms of grain

<u>Furthermore, profit rate varies directly with changes in productivity, and inversely with real wages.</u> These two facts constitute the fundamental core of Ricardo’s theorem.

In non-agricultural sectors, product and its means of production are two different commodities, and thus it is necessary to measure surplus and profit rates with relative prices due to the fact that, since wages are expressed in terms of grain, we need to find a way to translate quantities expressed in quantities of those sector. E.g.: profit rate in the textile sector can be expressed either in terms of cloth or grain.

<u>Ricardo accepted Smith’s idea of uniform rates of profit across sectors when πg = πc. However, when πg &lt; πc, capitalists will leave agriculture and invest in textiles, where π is higher.</u> The only way to obtain a uniform rate of profit in this case is to reduce πc by reducing the pc/pg rate. This is because, according to our assumptions, the techniques used within the product process do not change, as well as profit rates. The profit rate of the production of corn will never change, for example.

<u>Ricardo used this model to describe the effects of regulations of grain imports on the profit rate.</u> The following table reports Ricardo’s numerical example:<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:6.69298in;height:2.6337in" />

In Period 1, only the most fertile land is cultivated, and its products are expected to satisfy al the demand. In Period 2, there are two lands, and capitalists compete to produce in the best one by offering landowners rent.

But what happens if production can’t satisfy all the demand in Period 2? There are two possible consequences:

<u>The import duty is 0</u>

If the production techniques abroad are the same as in the domestic country, the situation remains as described in Period 1. Workers’ surplus goes to capitalists, rents equal to zero, and the profit rate is at 50%.

<u>The import duty is very high</u>

The situation is the same as the one described in Period 2. Importing grain is virtually impossible, so more land must be cultivated to meet demand. The way in which this happens is that described in Period 2.

The result is that the profit rate is homogeneous in all lands, even if it is lower than in Period 1 (because the productivity of labour is less on marginal lands of inferior quality).

<u>When demand rises, more inferior lands come into cultivation, determining a further decrease in profit rate</u>. The rent is the result of the presence of marginal lands and is called the differential rent. As a consequence, profit rate is given by marginal land and is reduced with respect to Period 1. <u>Thus, since π must be equal in all the sectors of the economy, the reduction in profit rate occurs throughout the economy.</u>

But why is profit rate determined by marginal lands?

Because of a precise concept on the distribution of income between wages, rent, and profits. Wages are at the subsistence level, and rent is determined by the productivity of marginal lands, so profit is residue.

<u>THE LABOUR THEORY OF VALUE</u>

In an economy where only grain is produced, <u>profits can simply be obtained as residue without the use of prices. However, in an economy where more goods are produced, this is not a plausible assumption, because it is impossible to determine profit rate without a theory of relative prices.</u>

Ricardo’s awareness of this problem made him look for a theory of value that had the ability to satisfy two essential requirements:

It must enable the measurement of output and wage rate independently of profit rate, which is the dependent variable

It must enable that changes in production techniques result in changes in relative prices

Ricardo believed that Smith’s theory of labour embodied (LE) could explain relative prices for all reproducible commodities. <u>Differently from Smith, Ricardo believed that LE could also be applied to capitalist economies.</u> Moreover, given two commodities a and be:

λa/λb = Pa/Pb

Where:

λ = labour embodied

P = price

Sinde λa = λb, and λb = lb, where l is the quantity of labour directly employed in the production of one unit of the good, then:

Pa/Pb = la/lb

<u>This is the equation of the labour theory of value: the relative price of the two commodities is determined by the ratio of the quantities of labour required in their production.</u>

There are two exceptions to this theory:

Production periods may differ

The two processes of production may employ not only wages as capital, but also other instruments and equipments in different proportions

In both cases, <u>the ratio of prices no longer depends exclusively on labour embodies (LE); profit rate is also a key element, and on that occasion, the labour theory no longer holds.</u> Ricardo, aware of such exceptions, attributed them to the different proportions in which fixed and circulating capital are employed in the production of different commodities.

<u>THE FALLING RATE OF PROFIT THEORY</u>

<u>If these exceptions are ignored, Ricardo’s model can be used to explain the theory of falling rates of profit.</u> In the long run and with the absence of external forces, the economy will reach a point of zero growth, known as steady-state. The forces that can prevent a falling rate of profit are:

The introduction of new technology that increases production

The abolition off import duties on wheat preventing cultivation in less fertile lands

<u>THE THEORY OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE</u>

<u>19th-century</u> British economist David Ricardo was the first to develop the theory of comparative advantage, an <u>economic theory that attributes the cause and benefits of international trade to the differences in the relative opportunity costs</u> (costs in terms of other goods given up) <u>of producing the same commodities among countries</u>.

According to Ricardo, as the demand of food increases due to population growth, this implies the descent of profit rate (which is wages and rent subtracted from labour values). <u>One way to avoid an increase in the rental rate and a decrease in the profit rate is international trade, which may help obtain the additional quantity of food requested by people without observing an increase in rent</u>.

In this theory, Ricardo examines the condition in which international trade brings positive results in two countries (he takes Portugal and England into consideration in the example seen below the illustration). He examines the conditions where international trade produces positive results, even if one country shows an absolute advantage with specific goods (even if one country is able to produce all goods at low prices, there is space for international trade). This happens <u>when a country has a comparative advantage in produces at least one good</u>.<img src="media/image5.png" style="width:2.97188in;height:3.45652in" />

In Ricardo’s example, two countries (Portugal and England) are able to produce, respectively, wine and cloth. In Portugal, the production of one litre of wine requires 80 hours of labour, whereas 90 hours are needed to obtain 1 measure of cloth. In England, the production of the same cloth and wine require 120 and 100 hours, respectively.

<u>Even if Portuguese labour is more efficient and thus has an absolute advantage, seeing the ratio of producing wine in comparison with the production of cloth, we note that England is comparatively more efficient in producing cloth than wine</u>. This serves as a justification of the positive effects of international trade and the abolishment of Corn Laws (the Corn Laws caused the price of 'corn', which also includes barley, corn, wheat, and all other grains, to increase; the Laws were designed to protect English farmers from inexpensive foreign imports of grain).<img src="media/image6.png" style="width:6.69298in;height:2.25376in" />

Karl Marx (1818-1883)

Karl Marx can be considered a classical economist even if he distanced himself from the classics in some ways. <u>He stressed the importance of profit as a driver of economic development, and his analysis is focused on the study of social classes’ behaviour.</u>

But at the same time, Marx was quite different from classic scholars because <u>he believed they were unable to truly understand the capitalistic system and its implications for the working class</u>. Marx’s contributions were the product of the period he lived in, called the “dark age of capitalism”, where <u>factories were organised in a brutal way, and the organisation was focused on exploiting workers</u>. Thus, his contributions can only be understood within this context.

His main contributions can be divided into six categories:

Mode of Production

Surplus, profits, and the exploitation of labour

Profits and Growth

The three laws of motion of capitalism

Crises of capitalism system

Transformation of labour values in prices

<u>MODE OF PRODUCTION</u>

The aim of Marx’s work was to <u>study society’s evolution</u>. This historical process is determined by transformations that concern the so-called mode of production (MP). MP, also known as economic base, is composed of:

<u>Productive forces (PF):</u> labour, raw materials, means of production, machinery, equipment, and production techniques (dynamic)

<u>Relations of production (RP):</u> all mechanisms regulating the use and ownership of the means of work and production, and determining the distribution of the final output (static)

<u>Each historical phase has always been characterised by a specific</u> mode of production (MP), which is maintained as long as there is a balance between productive forces (PF) and relations of production (RP).

In a period of economic development, <u>changes within the PF break the balance between PF and RP</u> (this change could also be of a technological nature). <u>At this point, a phase of crisis and social conflicts opens, which leads to a change of the MP</u>.

All major shifts in economic systems have been characterised by class conflicts/struggles generated by technological improvements. Let’s take a look at how the delicate balance between PF, RP, and Technological Innovations plays out in different types of societies:

PRIMITIVE SOCIETY

In a primitive society, productive forces (PF) are constituted by labour, which includes <u>hunting and gathering with rather primitive tools</u>.

Relations of production (RP), on the other hand, <u>focused on cooperation and the redistribution of output</u>.

The technological innovation that broke the balance between PF and RP was the invention of agriculture, which then lead to a change in mode of production (MP).

SLAVE-BASED SOCIETY

In a slaved-base society, productive forces (PF) are constituted by labour, which includes <u>rudimentary agricultural tools</u>.

Relations of production (RP), on the other hand, <u>focused on private ownership of land, slavery, and the output property of the aristocratic upper class</u>.

The technological innovation that broke the balance between PF and RP was the discovery of new agricultural production techniques, which then lead to a change in mode of production (MP).

<u>FEUDAL SOCIETY</u>

In a feudal society, productive forces (PF) are constituted by labour, which includes <u>land, natural resources, and agricultural tools</u>.

Relations of production (RP), on the other hand, <u>focused on the private ownership of land and natural resources. Here, slaves are partially free (they are called serfs), and a small fraction of agricultural output is property of these serfs</u>.

The technological innovation that broke the balance between PF and RP was the development of shipping, the discover of guns, and of steels, which then lead to a change in mode of production (MP).

<u>MERCANTILE PRE-CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY</u>

In a mercantile pre-capitalistic society, productive forces (PF) are constituted by labour, which includes <u>peasant/factory workers in the cottage industry, land, natural resources, the use of advanced agricultural tools, and rudimentary equipment</u>.

Relations of production (RP), on the other hand, <u>focused on the private ownership of lands and means of production, the control of workforce, colonial exploitation of work and natural resources, and owning of the final product by farmers and/or merchant-capitalists</u>.

The technological innovation that broke the balance between PF and RP was the invention of the steam engine, which then lead to a change in mode of production (MP).

CAPITALIST SOCIETY (ours)

In a capitalist society, productive forces (PF) are constituted by labour, which includes <u>factory workers, advanced machinery, and equipment</u>.

Relations of production (RP), on the other hand, <u>focused on the private ownership of means of production and of the workforce, and the private ownership of the final product of entrepreneurs</u>.

A technological innovation that would change our mode of production (MP) <u>is yet to be seen.</u>

-.-

<u>SURPLUS, PROFITS, AND THE EXPLOITATION OF LABOUR</u>

Pre-capitalist systems differ greatly from capitalist systems with regard to the circulation of commodities. In primitive, feudal, and simple mercantilist systems, <u>producers owned the means of production and the output they obtained from this labour</u>. In all of the pre-capitalist systems, the worker was a commodity. They could therefore be traded for money.

In these economic systems, exchange on the market was aimed at <u>obtaining commodities which satisfied needs that the limited specialisation of labour couldn’t satisfy directly</u>.

In pre-capitalist systems, the process of circulation of commodities can be seen as:

\(1\) C (commodity) —&gt; M (money) —&gt; C (commodity)

Commodities are exchanged for money in order to obtain other commodities and satisfy utilities. In a capitalist system, the means of production and the workforce are owned by the capitalists/entrepreneurs. <u>The capitalist spends the available money to purchase means of production and workforce, which will be used to produce commodities, which in turn will be sold to obtain money</u>.

The process of circulation of commodities is:

\(2\) M —&gt; C —&gt; M + ΔM (increase in money obtained from the sale of the commodity produced)

Under capitalism, <u>the exchange of money for commodities is a valid process for</u> workers <u>who sell their workforce in exchange for the money needed to buy subsistence goods</u> under capitalism, meaning that workers’ circulation of commodities are seen as (1)

The capitalists, on the other hand, <u>are driven exclusively by (2), as their objective is to accumulate more and more money</u>. How can capitalists obtain more money at the end of the production process?

<u>The capitalist can obtain an amount of money (ΔM &gt; 0) because they are able to exploit workers</u>. The value of quantities is expressed in terms of the quantity of labour directly and indirectly necessary to produce them (labour theory of value).

Imagine a workday production process in which <u>all quantities are measured in terms of the time of labour necessary to produce them</u>. In the first part of this workday, <u>the worker produces goods with a value sufficient enough to repay his subsistence</u>. The rest of the workday is devoted to <u>producing goods that are taken by the capitalist</u>.

Surplus value is defined as <u>the amount of value produced by workers over and above the cost of their wages.</u><img src="media/image7.png" style="width:4.13128in;height:1.24147in" />

<u>A firm that pursues</u> maximum surplus <u>must increase the B-C part of the workday by either multiplying the length of the workday or reducing the amount of time necessary to pay for a labourer’s wage</u>.

The surplus is then generated because the worker is paid less than the value of what they produce. However, the value of a commodity is not only given by the quantities of labour directly necessary to produce it. <u>It is necessary to add the quantities of labour needed to produce the raw materials and means of production consumed in the production process</u>.

The value of the means of production and the raw materials consumed is transferred to the commodity. Marx used the term constant capital (c) to indicate the value of these goods consumed in the production process. <u>The term “constant” indicates that this value does not change during the production process, but is preserved and transferred into the value of the final goods produced</u>.

Only the labour force, as we have seen, is able to transfer a value greater than its own (a surplus value) in the final goods produced. The value advanced by the capitalist for purchasing labour power is called variable capital (v). <u>This term indicates the fact that this value transfers itself and surplus value into final goods</u>.

Formally, the value of final goods produced is:

λ = L x (1-h) + h x L + L x (1-h)

Where:

H = the percentage of a workday spent in producing the wage

H x L = labour needed to produce the output composing the wage

L x (1-h) = labour exploited by capitalists to produce the output

The rate of exploitation is equal to the ratio between surplus and variable capital:

σ = s/v = (1-h) x L/h x L = 1-h/h = 1/h - 1

σ is zero when h = 1 (<u>when workers spend all the time working for themselves</u>). From this equation, we obtain two other crucial indicators:

The profit rate (π), defined as <u>the ratio between the surplus and the amount of capital anticipated by capitalists</u>

π = s/(c+v)

The organic composition of capital (q), defined as <u>the ratio between the constant capital and the total amount of capital</u>

q = c(c+v)

According to these relations, we can express profit rate as:

π = (s/v) x \[v/(c+v)\] = σ(1-q)

The <u>profit rate increases</u> as <u>exploitation rate increases,</u> and <u>decreases as organic composition of capital increases</u>.

-.-

<u>PROFITS AND GROWTH</u>

The profit rate is an important variable in Marxian economics, as it represents a key determinant of capital accumulation an investment

The growth rate of an economy is an accumulation of profit rate:

ΔY/Y = a x π = a x σ(1-q)

The growth rate of the economic depends on the profit rate through the accumulation of capital. A rise in exploitation rate causes a rise in the growth rate of the economy; thus, <u>a rise in organic composition of capital causes a fall in growth</u>.

-.-

<u>THE THREE LAWS OF MOTION OF CAPITALISM</u>

The development process of the capitalist system is defined by 3 laws:

<u>THE TENDENCY OF PROFIT RATE TO FALL</u>

The equation of profit rate \[π = (s/v) x \[v/(c+v)\] = σ(1-q)\] is the basis of this theory. <u>In the long run, due to the introduction of new machines replacing labour, the organic composition of capital will grow, reducing profit</u>. In order to avoid that, an upward trend of q decreases the profit rates (π), some events may favour the increase of exploitation rate sigma:

AN EXTENSION OF THE WORKING DAY

REDUCTION OF THE TIME SPENT IN PRODUCING WORKERS’ WAGES

INCREASE IN THE PACE OF WORK TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY

EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO IMPORTANT SUBSISTENCE GOODS AT A LOWER PRICE

Of these four events, only the first produces an increase in the exploitation rate (σ) and profit rate (π) because, in other situations, we have an increase in surplus and a decrease in variable capital (v); this means we have a positive effect on the exploitation rate (σ), but, if variable capital (v) changes, this influences the organic composition of capital (q), and therefore the overall effect on profit rate (π) is uncertain.

<u>THE INCREASED IMMISERATION OF THE WORKING CLASS</u>

The wage rate that is formed on the market is governed by the level of unemployment that Marx defines as the “reserve army of labour”. This “army of the unemployed” <u>increases as the supply of labour increases, and decreases as the demand for labour increases</u>.

The demand for labour depends (positively) on the organic composition of capital (q), and negatively on the production techniques adopted. <u>If capital accumulation is high, the army of the unemployed shrinks, and the wage rate goes above the subsistence leve</u>l.

This favourable situation for workers is temporary, however, because:

The increase in the wage rate lowers the rate of profit, causing a reduction in investment in capital and thus in demand for labour

The increase in wage rate pushes firms to increase the introduction of new labour-replacing machines in the production process

<u>Both effects lead to an increase in the unemployed and a reduction of the wage rate</u>. The rising level of unemployment is a defining feature of capitalist systems, and serves to keep wages at a subsistence level. <u>Unemployment is caused by the development of the capitalist system</u>.

The continuous increase in unemployment is the reason why, in this economy, workers live in misery. <u>But historical data from the last century for developed countries shows a notable increase in real wages</u>. Some authors have suggested that <u>the theory of increasing immiseration of the working class should be interpreted in a relative sense. The workers would be worse off relative to that of the capitalist entrepreneurs</u>.

<u>THE INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CAPITAL</u>

According to Marx, with the increase of capital accumulation, <u>many self-employed workers (like artisans) are unable to compete with capitalists</u>. They shut down their business activities and join the army of the unemployed.

As the accumulation process proceeds, large firms will be eliminated from the market. These firms will be absorbed by the most successful capitalists. This process is called capital concentration: <u>the transformation of many smaller capitals into a few larger ones.</u> The development of capitalist systems, as predicted by Marx, has effectively led to the formation of large concentrations of capital. <u>An important aspect of modern economics is in fact the presence of very large multinational companies operating at a global level</u>.

Increase in class immiseration and capital concentration cause:

The progressive immiseration of the working class and the simultaneous increase in the concentration of capital (this will eventually lead to a rebellion)

The working class will be increasingly united and organised thanks to the capitalist production process; the monopoly of capital is a constraint of the capitalist mode of production that must be shut down (the expropriators will be expropriated)

Revolution is the consequence, and capitalism will collapse leading to the formation of a more modern system (socialism)

<u>These three laws are the result of the capitalists’ desire to accumulate more and more money and replace workers with machines</u>. This substitution process results in an <u>increase</u> in the organic composition of capital (q).

Only the first point produces an increase in the exploitation rate (σ) and profit rate (π) because, in other situations, we have an increase in surplus and a decrease in the organic composition of capital (q); so we have a positive effect on the exploitation rate (σ), but, if the organic composition of capital (q) changes, we have an effect on the organic composition of capital (q), and therefore the overall effect on the profit rate (π) is uncertain.

We may encounter limits in this system, called insurmountable limits: <u>the day cannot exceed 24 hours, and workers can encounter health problems</u>. For Marx, the value of constant capital can grow without any limit. The inevitable consequence is the fall to zero of the profit rate (π) and of ΔY/Y.

This is a major flaw in Marx’s analysis. Marx did not consider that q and sigma are interrelated through V. An increase in organic composition of the organic composition of capital (q) normally increases the physical productivity of labour. <u>An increase in this reduces the socially necessary labour time required to produce the workers’ wage, and raises the rate of exploitation</u>. Marx has overlooked the fact that an increase in the organic composition of capital (q) normally entails an increase in the exploitation rate (σ). As the organic composition of capital (q) increases, so does the exploitation rate (σ). Thus, the fall in the rate of profit is not automatic.

-.-

<u>THE CRISIS OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM</u>

Similarly to Malthus, <u>Marx did not accept Say’s law. He claimed that capitalists may decide to reduce the purchases of the means of production and of labour power in the perspective of not receiving adequate profits from the selling of goods.</u>

If, within the scheme M &gt; C &gt; M + ΔM, the ratio ΔM/M which measures the realised profits rate falls, capitalists might decide not to invest the money from the sales to produce new goods.

<u>Consequently, the demand for means of production and labour will decrease, causing the crisis of this system.</u> It is due to the fall of the profit rate, not because workers are substituted with machines but because goods can be sold at a value that does not allow to obtain satisfactory profit. This is known as non-realisation of surplus value.

In order to solve the problem, Marx developed reproduction schemes: <u>abstract representationS of the economy by means of which he analysed the conditions enabling to sell goods at their fair value, namely the conditions necessary to guarantee equilibrium between demand and a supply both of consumer and investment goods in the system.</u>

Marx distinguished between two types of reproduction schemes:

1.  SIMPLE REPRODUCTION SCHEME

The net investment is zero, and the system always reproduces at the same level of output.

2.  EXPANDED REPRODUCTION SCHEME

The net investment is positive, and the output produced increases over time.

The formula for net investment is therefore:

NET INVESTMENT = TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES - THE COST OF MEANS OF PRODUCTION CONSUMED DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS

The simple reproduction scheme is based on the following assumptions:

1.  The economy is closed

2.  The economy is divided into two sectors: the one reproducing the means of reproduction and the one producing consumer goods

3.  All products are sold at their values, measured in working hours (&gt;theory of value)

4.  There is no technical progress

5.  The wages correspond to the subsistence level

6.  The investment is only devoted to machinery and the means consumed in the production process

Now, we define the value of output of sectors 1 and 2, y1 and y2, as:

y1 = c1 + v1 + s1

y2 = c2 + v2 + s2

Where:

-   c = constant capital

-   v = variable capital

-   s = surplus

<u>This equilibrium is found by balancing demand and supply in each sector</u>, resulting in:

c2 = v1 + s1

If this condition is satisfied, the system is able to reproduce the same level of output in each period. <u>Nonetheless, Marx argued that there was no certainty that the condition could be fulfilled.</u> For instance, we know that c1 and c2 repress the value of capital stock consumed in production process 1 and 2. It is easy to imagine this condition as always satisfied if the age-structure of all machinery in the system is uniformly distributed. However, if the age-structure of the machines in the system is not uniform, then in some periods the demand for machines to be replaced will higher or lower in each sector. <u>Thus, either a boom or a crisis phases will arise:</u>

1.  BOOM PHASES

In boom phases, demand exceeds supply, and hence there are increases in the prices of investment and subsistence goods.

3.  CRISIS PHASE

Supply exceeds demand, and hence economic activity is reduced and unemployment increases.

The alternation of these phases in the capitalist system is the norm in the absence of uniformity in the age-structure of capital.

<u>THE TRANSFORMATION OF VALUES INTO PRICES</u>

The theory of exploitation is <u>based on the labour theory of value to express the difference magnitudes in homogeneous terms.</u> Indeed, Marx was aware that the exchange values of goods in the market did not correspond to the hours of labour necessary to produce them, but, on the contrary, they were based on production prices. <u>Therefore, Marx worked on the problem of the transformation of labour values into prices, known as</u> the theory of prices.

From the equations y1 = c1 + v1 + s1 and y2 = c2 + v2 + s2 it is possible to deduce that the profit rate of sector 1 and 2 can be calculated as follows:

π1 = σ1 (1 – q1)

π1 = σ2 (1 – q2)

In agreement with Smith and Ricardo, <u>Marx assumed the existence of free competition among capitalists</u>, which implies that:

The rate of profit in the various sectors of the economy is the same

Wage rate, the length of a working day, and the exploitation rate are identical in all sectors

Thus, in order to have π1 = σ1, in the previous equation, two more conditions need to be fulfilled:

q1 = q2

Technology must be identical in all sectors (this is a highly unrealistic condition)

As a result, <u>to have both a uniform rate of profit and different techniques of production, the labour embodied as a measure of value had to be abandoned.</u> The new measure implied that the prices of production were directly derived from labour values by applying the same rate of profit in the two sectors.

However, also this solution has problems, for <u>the ratio between the quantities of labour contained the commodities corresponds to the prices ration only if</u>:

σ = 0. This implies that also π = 0

q is the same in both sectors

Ultimately, it can be noticed that Marx’s analysis of prices suffers form problems similar to those of Ricardo’s analysis: prices differ from values. In the face of such an issue, Marx sustained that:

-    the labour theory of value, even if ineffective in this case, is useful to solve problems at the macro level, such as for the calculation of the GDP

-    the labour theory of value can act as a theory of exploitation for the economy as a whole. At the aggregate level, profits are derived from surplus labour, reflecting the main contradiction of capitalism: the conflict between workers and capitalists, which emerges in the production process where exploitation takes place.

<u>The mistake made by Marx in transforming values into prices was highlighted and mathematically corrected by Bortkiewicz in 1907</u>. In fact, in the system the two commodities are exchanged according to the process of production when they are regarded as output, but they are evaluated at their labour values when used as inputs.

The Forerunners of Neoclassical Economics

The neoclassical school, also known with the term marginalists, is often dates to the <u>1870’s</u>. One of its hallmarks is the use of marginal concepts (such as marginal utility, marginal cost and marginal products) <u>to determine the behaviour which drives the market forces of supply and demand.</u> The term “neoclassical” was first introduced by Veblen and identifies a new (“neo”) vision of reality, but still influenced by some classical ideas. These are, traditionally,

-    Utilitarianism &gt; Bentham; Gossen

-   Marginal principle &gt; Ricardo; Von Thunen; Cournot; Dupuit; Gossen

-   Laissez-faire &gt; Smith; Mill

-   Say’s law

Von Thunen, Cournot, Dupuit, and Gossen are known as proto-marginalists. The neoclassical and classical schools differ between each other in a way which is displayed by the following table.

FORERUNNERS

<u>JEREMY BENTHAM (1748-1832)</u>

His main contribution was utilitarianism, i.e., <u>the principle of pure happiness according to which the rightness of wrongness of our actions are functions of the amount of pleasure or pain they produce.</u> The desire to maximise utility is how humans ought to act.

This contribution opened the road to the marginalist revolution and funded the construction of a “science of human happiness”, endowed with mathematical precision. Bentham also elaborated a method to quantify pleasure and pain, that “will be treated or less according to \[...\] its intensity, its direction; its certainty or uncertainty; its propinquity or remoteness; its fecundity; its purity; its extent”.

<u>HERMAN HEINRICH GOSSEN (1810-1858)</u>

Herman’s main contributions were:

THE SUBJECT THEORY OF VALUE

The value of a thing reflects the utility or enjoyment experienced by the individual that owns it.

THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS

The added utility of a good decreases as more of it is consumed.

THE MARGINAL COST OF ACQUISITION

When in equilibrium, an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (the marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all goods and services:

Mux/Px = Muy/Py

Where:

Mux and Muy = marginal utilities of two independent goods x and y

Px and Py = prices

<u>JOHANN HEINRICH VON THUNEN (1783-1850)</u>

Johann’s main contribution was the application of Ricardo’s marginal principle in a theory of employment: added units of labour lead to successively smaller increases in total production. Thus, <u>the employer must hire labour until the cost of the last addition equals the value of the added good produced</u> (in other words, when the marginal revenue product of labour equals the wage expense of hiring a worker).

<u>AUGUSTINE COURNOT (1801-1877)</u>

He is considered to be <u>the first economics to apply mathematics to economic analysis.</u> His main contribution was the analysis of the rates of change of total cost and revenue functions. Such rates of change, which are mathematical derivatives, translate into what economists now refer to as marginal cost and marginal revenue.

<u>ARSENE JULES EMILE DUPUIT (1804-1866)</u>

He is the first economist to present a convincing discussion of concept of marginal utility in relation with the demand curve: <u>the utility of an individual or individual units obtained from a homogeneous stock of commodities is determined by the use to which the last units of the stock are destined.</u> This way, Dupuit clearly points out that the marginal utility of a stock of some particular goods diminishes worth increases in quantity: utility is a decreasing function of the quantity consumed.

The theory of marginal utility is used by Dupuit to establish the general theory of consumer demand, which implies a negative relationship between a product’s price and the amount of it people will to buy. <u>Therefore, in Dupuit’s formulation, a demand curve is simply a marginal utility curve: consuming successive units of a particular good determines increasingly less extra satisfaction.</u> Thus consumers will not buy additional units of the good unless its price falls.

<u>JOHN STUART MILL (1806-1873)</u>

His main contribution was his emphasis on laissez-faire, free trade, and economic liberalisation. In his <u>1848</u> “Principles of Political Economy”, Mill advances a number of powerful arguments supporting economic liberty. In his view, “laissez faire \[…\] should be the general practice: every departure from it, unless required by some great good, is a certain evil.”

These various authors are merely forerunners because <u>they do no belong to any particular school</u>. This is due to various reasons: most of them (such as Smith, Bentham, Ricardo, Mill, and Say) are classical scholars, while others (like von Thunen, Cournot, Dupuit, and Gossen) do not belong to any economic school of thought.

The Neoclassical Breakthrough

The ideas at the basis of marginalism arose almost simultaneously in different places and from different people, with the dissatisfaction with old theories as a common denominator. As a clearly defined schools of thought, marginalism originated with W. S. Jevons in England, C. Merger in Austria, and L. Walras in Switzerland.

<u>The neoclassical system of economic thought is interested in analysing the allocation of given resources among alternative uses, one of its main contributions being the value theory of price.</u>

The neoclassical school also accepts the utilitarian approach: the maximisation of utility by consumer and of profit by firms leads to choosing the optimal alternative between the available resources. <u>The fundamental role of utility is that the individual becomes dominant in determining economic values and, hence, is at the centre of the neoclassical analysis.</u>

The development of the individualistic approach can be justified as a <u>reaction towards the classical stream of thought and the Marxist direction it had taken.</u> In addition, the marginalist school evolved in the attempt to find suitable solutions to theoretical problems the classical school had been unable to solve, above all:

<u>THE LABOUR THEORY OF VALUE</u>

This suffers from difficulties related to the “vicious cycle” and “logical inconsistency” that resulted from Smith’s analysis, as well as the divergence between prices and labour value ratio that resulted from Ricardo’s and Marx’s analysis. This theory is utterly unable to solve the sandcastle paradox: if sandcastles are made of labour, why do they not have any value?

As an answer, neoclassical thinkers hold that the value of any good or service is determined by its marginal utility.

<u>THE WAGE-SUBSISTENCE THEORY</u>

This is incompatible with utility-based theories because its classical elaboration entails that the wage payments are fixed at a subsistence level. Furthermore, it is only feasible in an agricultural economy.

<u>WILLIAM STANLEY JEVONS (1835-1882)</u>

W. S. Jevons was a <u>British economist and professor of political economy at University College</u>. He introduced fundamental results for neoclassical intellectuals concerning the utility theory. <u>Jevons associated himself with Bentham, with whom shared the concept of pleasures and pains being functional to utility</u>. He also introduced the principle of marginal utility as a decreasing function of the quantity consumed of a good. Jevon’s theory of diminishing marginal utility (DMU) is similar to Gossen’s and Dupuit’s ideas, where marginal refers to changes on the border.

The concept of DMU leads to a theory of prices: <u>when an additional unit of good is generally agreed to generate less satisfaction, it will be purchased only in the case in which its prices decreases. Therefore, the resulting demand is negatively related to price and this, along with supply, contributes to the determination of the equilibrium or “natural” price of the good</u>.

-.-

<u>LEON WALRAS (1834-1910)</u>

L. Walras was a <u>French marginalist who interprets economy as a pure mathematical science. His major contribution is</u> the theory of general economic equilibrium. The relationship among different markets had been analysed by Quesnay, <u>but no one before Walras had managed, by means of the marginal theory, to provide a general theoretical structure capable of accounting or the multiple relationships among the markets, with a peculiar attention to the interdependence in consumption choices</u>.

<u>WALRAS’ THEORY OF GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM</u>

Walras focused on the dynamics underlining exchanges in the economy, namely the interactions between the prices of goods, the quantity of goods, and the demand for goods. His idea is that any change in the economy results in further changes radiating with gradually diminishing force.

<u>Such is a “reverberation” process which continues until the equilibrium is achieved simultaneously in all the markets</u>. In fact, according to Walras’s mathematical view, in the economy. there are the same balancing forces evident in Newton’s law of motion: everything is interrelated and one small change in one part of the economy can modify the entire economy.

E.g.: the theory of general equilibrium is evident in relation to the concepts of substitutes and complements: <u>when two goods are substitutes, such as butter and oil, an increase in the price of one determines an increase in the consumption of the other</u>; when two goods are complements, such as cars and gasoline, an increase in the price of one results in the decrease of the demand of the other.

According to this model, the economy is constituted by a plurality of agents who are present on the market either as consumers or as suppliers. In particular, each consumer has a double role: they buy commodities and sell services of factors to firms.

Therefore, <u>each consumer is described by two equations: one accounting for their demands of the different commodities, and the other accounting for the supplies of factor inputs</u>. The same can be observed for each firm, which is represented by both demand and supply equations. T<u>he hallmark of these equations is their simultaneity or interdependence, that is the demand Dx and the supply Sx of each commodity x depend not only on the price px of that commodities, but also on the prices of all other commodities</u>:

Dx = f(px, py, pw)

Sx = g(px, py, pw)

This holds for all commodities.

Imagine that there are M markets for consumption goods and N markets for production factors. <u>In equilibrium, in each market demand D and supply S must be equal. This conditions results in a system of M + N equations of the form D = S, whose unknowns are the M + N prices at which all markets are in equilibrium.</u> The situation in which all markets are in equilibrium is called general equilibrium.

However, there is an issue to be considered, that is, <u>whether there actually exists a set of M + N prices such that at those prices all M + N markets are in equilibrium</u>. Since the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns, it could be thought that a solution exists, but that is not the case. This results form the so called Walras’ law: <u>in this framework if (M + N) – 1 markets are in equilibrium, it necessarily holds true for the last (M +N) – n market. Therefore, the number of unknowns happens to be larger than the number of independent equations and, consequently, the system remains unsolved.</u>

One possible solution consists in choosing arbitrarily the price of one commodity as “numeraire”, or unit of account, and express all other prices in terms of it. <u>This way, they are determined only as ratios, namely each of them is given relative to the price of the numeraire</u>.

<u>THE TATONNEMENT</u>

<u>Walras refers to the process of adjustment to the prices to their equilibrium levels as</u> tatonnement, in other words “trial and error”, led by an auctioneer. At the opening of the M + N markets, the auctioneer announces the M + N prices. <u>After that, all agents take the announced prices as given, being then price-takers, and declare how much of consumption goods and production factor are willing to buy or sell at that price.</u> Subsequently, the auctioneer calculates the aggregate demand D and aggregate supply S for each commodity. If all M + N markets are in equilibrium, trades are carried out.

On the other hand, the auctioneer announces new M + N prices, which are higher on the markets where there was an excess of demand, lower on markets where there was an excess if supply. <u>The tatonnement continues until a general equilibrium is reached. By collecting all the information about demand and supply of each commodity in the market, otherwise dispersed, once the equilibrium is reached, Walras’s auctioneer can allocate all the commodities appropriately.</u>

<u>CRITICISMS</u>

The theory of general equilibrium has been criticised for some aspects:

In its most basic form, it assumes that all markets in the economy are perfect, whereas many are not

All trades are carried out only when markets have reached the equilibrium; but it appears implausible that in reality it is so

The exact form of the demand and supply functions used in the theory remains  
unspecified; the theory assumes that the demand and supply for each commodity depend on the price of all commodities, but says nothing about how to specify this dependence

There are too many equations and many unknowns, hence the solution of such a system becomes exceedingly complex; even modern computers struggle with the elaboration of such numerous and complex variables

The New Generation

The marginalist scholars working between the end of the <u>19th century</u> and the early <u>1920’s</u> conquered the academic circles of almost all Western countries, and contributed to the creation of a new, dominant theoretical system.

While much respect was given to the first generation (Jevons, Walras, and Mengers), <u>they only focused on factors that influenced demand</u>; the “new” group of scholars, on the other hand, <u>considered both demand and supply factors when determining the prices of goods, services, and resources.</u>

This group of new scholars includes:

Alfred Marshall

Philip Henry Wicksteed

Francis Ysidro Edgeworth

Arthus Cecil Pigou

Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk

Friedrich von Wieser

John Bates Clark

Irving Fisher

Knut Wicksell

Gustav Cassel

These economists deepened and extended the previous generation’s analysis, introducing and popularising many of the concepts that today’s students study, such as the indifference curve and the contract curve.

Alfred Marshall (1842-1924)

Alfred was a British economist who was the most important neoclassical intellectual of the second generation. At school and as a student at Cambridge University, he showed an aptitude for mathematics. Alfred had the luck of being a student of the great physicist Maxwell, and the mathematician Clifford.

Like Jevons (but differently from Walras), Alfred promoted the partial-equilibrium approach (<u>the analysis of an equilibrium in a single market, rather than general equilibrium in a system of markets</u>). Unlike Jevons and Menger, Marshall gave equal importance to both demand and supply.

Marshall’s most important contributions are:

The supply and demand diagram/Marshallian cross

Consumer and producer surplus

Perfect competition

Price-elasticity of demand

Economies of scale

<u>HOW CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR INFLUENCES THE DEMAND CURVE</u>

The theory of consumer behaviour is based on the law of decreasing marginal utility. <u>According to this law, the satisfaction given by an additional unit of any product decreases as the units consumed increase</u>.

He distinguished between two types of utility:

TOTAL UTILITY

Total utility is the overall amount of satisfaction that a person derives from consuming a particular quantity of a good.

MARGINAL UTILITY

Marginal utility, on the other hand, is the extra satisfaction a consumer achieves with an additional unit of that product.

<u>To maximise satisfaction, the consumer must allocate his income in such a way that the last Euro spent on each product gives the same amount of extra utility</u> (marginal utility).

Consider a consumer who, having an income of 13 euros, has to evaluate which combination of apples and oranges to buy:

<img src="media/image9.png" style="width:6.69298in;height:2.01042in" />

Based on the data in the table, the combination of goods that maximises the consumer’s utility is 3 apples and 5 oranges. The familiar condition for maximum consumer satisfaction is easily derived from this equilibrium condition:

MUx/px = MUy/py = MUm

Where:

MUx = marginal utility of good x

px = demand price of good x

MUy = marginal utility of good y

py = demand price of good y

MUm = marginal utility of money

Thus, Marshall establishes the following equilibrium condition for the consumption of good x:

MUx = px x MUm

Px is (tacitly) the derivative of function F(x), which gauges the maximum amount of money that the person would be willing to give for every amount of x. <u>The equation above simply says that the maximum amount that a consumer would be willing to pay for an additional unit of x will be a quantity such that the utility that is lost in the giving of this amount of money px x MUm will be equal to the utility that will be received instead</u> (MUx).

Marshall assumed that the marginal utility in the consumption of goods was decreasing, while that of money was a constant μ. Changing the notation, we may rewrite the last equation as:

U’(x) = μ x px —&gt; f(x) = px

Where marginal utility is positive but decreasing, that is, U’ (x) &gt; 0, U’’ (x) &lt; 0, and f(x) is the Marshallian demand function, f(x) indicates the marginal valuation of successive units of x.

Starting from a condition of equilibrium, let’s suppose that px goes down. To restore the equation above, the consumer needs to lower f(x). <u>Based on the hypothesis of decreasing marginal utility, the consumed quantity of good x must increase to the point that f(x) = px</u>. The fall in price raises the quantity demanded.

Obviously, an increase in px will lead to a reduction in the quantity of good x consumed to the point that the equation above holds again. The rise in price reduces the quantity demanded.

The result only holds if MUm remains constant when prices change. <u>In reality, even the marginal utility of money can vary when the price of that good changes, but Marshall did not address the problem assuming that MUm = μ (where μ is a constant)</u>.

In addition to assuming the constancy of MUm, other assumptions are necessary for the price-marginal-utility mechanism to be valid: tastes, the prices of related goods, the prices of unrelated goods, and expectations of future prices must be constant.

<u>AGGREGATE DEMAND CURVE</u>

Because the marginal utility is decreasing, <u>the individual demand function is negatively sloped.</u> By summing the negatively sloped individual demand functions we obtain a negatively sloped market demand curve.

<u>PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND</u>

The price elasticity of demand is defined as <u>the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to change in price</u>. In other words, it is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

Price elasticity = PE = % Δquantity demanded/% Δprice

Demand is thus:

ELASTIC

The % change in quantity exceeds the % change in price (PE &gt; 1).

INELASTIC

The % change in quantity is less than the % change in price (PE &lt; 1).

UNIT-ELASTIC

The % change in quantity and the % change in prices are equal (PE = 1).

The factors determining the demand elasticity for a good are:

<u>The availability of close substitutes:</u> goods typically having close or perfect substitutes have highly elastic demands curves

<u>The position of a commodity in a consumer’s budget:</u> the greater the proportion of income spent on a commodity, the greater its demand elasticity will be

<u>Nature of the good:</u> luxury goods are price-elastic, while necessity goods are price inelastic

<u>Consumer habits:</u> if a consumer habitually consumed a commodity, its demand will be inelastic

<u>Number of uses of a commodity:</u> the more the possible uses of a commodity, the greater its price elasticity will be (and vice-versa)

<u>SUPPLY</u>

Marshall advanced the hypothesis that a <u>firm operates under a perfect competition regime</u>. Thus the market form is characterised by a large number of sellers, each of whom produces an infinitesimal part of the total output. In such conditions, the behaviour of the individual company does not allow a the market price to be changed: <u>firms are price-takers, namely they consider the price level determined by the market</u>.

<u>REVENUES AND COSTS</u>

The firm will chose the quantity to offer on the market in order to maximise profits, which are the difference between total revenues and total costs. <u>To understand by which dynamics the maximisation of profits is accounted for, it is necessary to consider how revenues and costs vary as the quantity produced by the firm changes</u>.

There is a distinction between revenues and costs:

TOTAL REVENUES

Price x quantity produced; graphically, this element appears as a straight line.

TOTAL COSTS

This is characterised by an inverse S-shaped trend. In a first period, when the quantity produced is low, the costs grow rapidly as they are spread over few goods produced. As production grows, costs tend to increase less rapidly as they are distributed over more units of product. Nonetheless, as the output grows further beyond the quantity Q’, costs tend to increase again, for to produce a large amount it will be necessary to pay the overtime to employees or to buy new machinery.

Equilibrium quantity is the quantity at which profits are maximised, and it corresponds to the point at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost:

MR = MC  
  
However, <u>this condition must occur in the increasing moment of the marginal cost curve, namely the part of the curve where total cost grows at increasing rates.</u>

<u>SUPPLY CURVE FORM</u>

If price goes up, the quantity offered also increases, which implies a <u>positive relationship between price and quantity produced</u>. For Marshall, the form of the resulting curve depends on the time horizon of the analysis. In particular, he distinguishes between:

A MARKET PERIOD

Supplies are fixed in amount.

A SHORT PERIOD

The quantities supplied can be increased, but productive capacity is fixed.

A LONG-RUN PERIOD

Productive capacity, which is all factors of production, is variable.

<u>THE SHORT-RUN</u>

In the short run, which corresponds to the market and short period, the firm may also be willing to suffer a loss. <u>In fact, the profit resulting from the production of a null quantity corresponds to the fixed costs -F, where the negative sign indicates the loss.</u> On the other hand, the profit resulting from producing a positive quantity of output equals:

P x Q - TC

The company should halt production when:

-F &gt; P x Q - TC

This can be rewritten as:

VC/Q &gt; P

Where VC/Q are the average variable costs. <u>If they are higher than P, it is better for the company to stop the business because the revenues do no cover variable production costs.</u>

Graphically, in the market period, the supply curve is a vertical line in correspondence of the quantity in which MR = MC, subjectively to the previous constraint (P &gt; VC/Q). <u>The curve form is due to the fact that, if the price increases, the firm could not increase the quantity produced, that would remain fixed.</u> On the other hand, in the short period, the supply curve corresponds to the increasing portion of the marginal cost curve, namely where TC grows at increasing rates, subjectively to the previous constraint (P &gt; VC/Q). The quantity of product offered by the firm increases as the price goes up.<img src="media/image10.png" style="width:5.35576in;height:2.50036in" />

<u>THE LONG-RUN</u>

In the long run, the firm can modify the production capacity. However, <u>this means that other firms will also be able to enter the market.</u> Therefore, in the long run, the average and marginal cost curves change. The long run average costs curve (LAC) is obtained for the envelope of the short run averages cost curves (SAC).<img src="media/image11.png" style="width:4.7518in;height:3.00605in" />

In this graphical representation, three total short-run cost curves (SAC1, SAC2, SAC3) are associates with three levels of production capacity. Up to quantity Q1 it is advisable to produce with plan 1 (SAC1 &lt; SAC2), up to quantity Q2 it is advisable to use plant 2 (SAC2 &lt; SAC3), for quantities grater that Q2 it S advisable to use plant 3 (SAC3 &lt; ).The envelope is given by the red curve. <u>In the case of an infinity of plants to choose form, the average cost curve would appears as the solid green line (LACc)</u>.<img src="media/image12.png" style="width:3.42944in;height:3.54978in" />

The long run marginal cost curve (LMC) can be obtained from the short-run marginal cost curves (SMC) in correspondence of different plant sizes. LMC is represented by the green curve. <u>Assuming an infinite number of implant sizes to choose from, the LMC curve will appear flatter than SMC</u>.

The firm’s long run supply curve will correspond to the rising segment of the LMC that is above the LAC and intersects it at its lowest point. <u>In fact, in the long run, the firm can at most obtain zero profits, which occur when p = LAC, but not negative ones</u>.

<u>SUPPLY CURVE AT THE INDUSTRY LEVEL</u>

In the short-run, the industry supply curve S(p) is obtained by summing the supply curves of the n firms S(p)i present in the market:<img src="media/image13.png" style="width:2.52531in;height:2.2311in" />

<u>In the long run, it is not possible to build the supply curve in the same way since, by definition, firms can either enter or exits the market.</u> Therefore, the trend of the long-term market supply curve depends on the different cost conditions relating to the factor market:

THE FACTOR PRICE REMAINS CONSTANT AS OUTPUT CHANGES

The firm operates at constant costs and the long-term supply curve is an horizontal line in correspondence of p = minimum AC (=average cost).

THE FACTOR PRICE INCREASES AS OUTPUT INCREASES (INCREASING COST INDUSTRY)

The long run market supply curve is positively sloped.

THE FACTOR PRICE DECREASES AS OUTPUT INCREASES (DECREASING COST INDUSTRY)

The long run market supply curve is negatively sloped.

<u>EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL ECONOMIES</u>

The decline or the rise in factor costs is determined by the presence of external economies or diseconomies:

EXTERNAL ECONOMIES OF SALE

These refer to factors that are beyond the control of an individual firm, but occur within the industry, and lead to such a cost benefit (e.g.: the localisation of an industry in a particular area).

EXTERNAL DISECONOMIES OF SALE

These refer to factors that are beyond the control of an individual firm, but occur within the industry, and lead to such a cost damage (e.g.: a company that emits harmful substances into the environment, decreasing the quality of raw materials used as inputs by firms).

<u>Internal economies, on the other hand, depend on the resources, the organisation and the efficiency of management of single firms</u>. From them, according to Marshall’s analysis, come positive impetus for progress, growth and improvement. Nonetheless, the problem is that internal economies are not compatible with the perfect competition hypothesis. Better internal organisation leads to cost and productivity advantages over other companies that would like to enter the sector, with the risk of the generation of monopolies.

<u>SUPPLY AND DEMAND DIAGRAM</u>

The intersection of the demand and supply curves represents the market equilibrium level of price and quantity:<img src="media/image14.png" style="width:2.59798in;height:2.78005in" />

<u>According to Marshall, the market is in disequilibrium if the supply price Ps, the one suppliers are willing to take, is different from the demand price Pd, the one consumers are willing to pay.</u> The occurrence of disequilibrium produces:

A SHORT-RUN EFFECT

Variation in quantity

A LONG-RUN EFFECT

Variation in prices (as a consequence of the short-run effect)

If Ps &lt; Pd, firstly the quantity in the market rises and secondly price decreases. On the other hand, if Ps &gt; Pd, firstly the quantity in the market decreases and secondly price increases.

<u>The Marshallian cross represents just one market, therefore equilibrium analysed by him is defined as partial.</u> This is a fundamental difference from Walras.

<u>CONSUMER AND PRODUCER SURPLUS</u>

The analysis of the Marshallian equilibrium in the short run implies the conceptualisation of two notions: producers’ surplus and consumers’ surplus. <u>They are maximised by the Marshallian cross, which is an efficient equilibrium.</u> Furthermore, differently from Ricardo’s concept of surplus, measured in terms of quantity of goods, Marshall’s surplus results from the concept of utility and is calculated in monetary terms.

PRODUCERS’ SURPLUS

The difference between what producers actually receive when selling a product and the amount they would be willing to accept for a unit of the good. In fact, while the equilibrium point corresponds to the equality between price and marginal cost, for all the quantities below the equilibrium the supplier takes a price which is higher then the marginal utility corresponding to those quantities. Therefore the difference represents a marginal profit. The sum of all marginal profits is a net total benefit for the firms.

CONSUMERS’ SURPLUS

The difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a unit of the good and the amount consumers actually do pay for the product. Consumers demand a good until the decreasing marginal utility is equal to the good’s market price.

For all units of consumption lower than that chosen at a given market price, consumers are willing to pay more than what they really pay. The difference represents a marginal satisfaction. The sum of all these marginal satisfactions is a net benefit for the consumers.

The two notions have been discussed in short-run terms. In the long run, firms are able to enter and exist market, implying that all firm’s profits and surplus tend to 0. <u>This means that, over the long run, under the condition of a perfect competition, there is no space for economic profits and surplus</u>.

The Austrian School

The Austrian scholars <u>represent a branch of the marginalists school.</u> Nonetheless, they differ form the “classical” marginalists inasmuch as they refuse the use of mathematical tools to argument their theses and results.

<u>CARL MENGER</u>

Menger was as an Austrian marginalist economist, considered to be the the founder of the marginalist school together with Jevons and Walras, along with its Austrian branch. <u>Like Jevons, Menger based his value theory on the concept of utility, but differently from him, the Austrian made no use of mathematics in his formulations, likewise avoiding their construction upon a Benthamite base.</u> His main contributions were:

THE NAURE AND VALUE OF GOODS

A good is such if it satisfies four conditions:

The presence of human needs

The connection between the item and people’s needs through the ability to satisfy them

The human acknowledgement of this connection

The ability to influence the item to bring it to meet people’s needs

Menger differentiates between:

GOODS OF THE FIRST ORDER (GFO)

This category includes consumption goods. On the other hand, production goods that satisfy indirect needs are called “goods of higher order” (GHO) to indicate that they temporally precede GFO goods: if GHO goods are not available, GFO goods are not either because they cannot be produced.

GOODS OF THE SECOND ORDER (GSO)

The category includes factor services entering in the production of final goods GFO. Hence, the value of GHOs is strongly linear to the value of GFOs. For instance, the rent received by landowners is determined by the utility of the products grown in the land.

<u>Goods become economic goods when their demand is larger than the quantities available in the market</u>. On the contrary, the abundance of a good removes it from a person’s economising behaviour. <u>GHO’s derive the nature of economic goods from the first order goods to which they are related. Hence, if A - an economic first order good with P, Q, R, S, T as respective goods of higher order – becomes uneconomic, then P, Q, R, S, T also become uneconomic goods</u>.

Consumption goods are classified according to their importance: some, like food and clothing are indispensable, while others, like tobacco or chessboards, serve only to add comfort or pleasure.  
<u>Not only the quality, but also the quantity consumed of each good has a different importance: a little foods preserves life, more food insure health and additional quantities bring little further satisfaction.</u> Menger illustrates by a numerical example the differences in the importance of the satisfaction given by various kinds of goods and its decrease as the quantity of the good is increased.<img src="media/image15.png" style="width:2.63101in;height:2.23466in" />

Menger never declared explicitly that the numbers he used had only an ordinal meaning: in several passages of his works he treated them as if they measured utilities in the classical sense of the term. <u>Most importantly, according to Menger, the value of a commodity is determined by the utility of the last consumed unit of the asset itself.</u> This constitutes a great difference from the classical marginalists, as the following example can show.

E.g.: as 7 units of a good are consumed, the corresponding utility, indicated in the first column, amounts to 4. This means that the utility of the marginal, namely the seventh, unit consumed is 4. <u>A classical marginalist, on the contrary, would have affirmed that the utility of such a good is calculated by the sum all previous utilities, which, in this case is:</u>

10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 49

THE THEORY OF EXCHANGE

The measure of value is subjective, hence <u>a commodity can have great value to one individual, little value to another, and no value at all to a third, depending on the differences in the preferences of the three individuals</u>. The basis of the exchange value is the difference in relative subjective evaluation of the same goods by different subjects.

E.g.: A values 100 units of his wheat by 40 units of wine, therefore the exchange ratio is 100/40. To complete the exchange, A must find another person willing to trade grain for wine at a lower ratio, for instance 80/40, to obtain a gain. Even if A pays 99 units of wheat for 40 of wine he will gain, while B will gain if he gets as little as 81 units of wheat. Hence, the limits of the exchange are determined by the value ratios of A and B.

<u>In this example, trading is undertaken to increase the total utility of the parties to the exchange. Menger suggested that there is a way to understand whether the exchange rate will be efficient in providing satisfaction to both parties, that is the exchange will take place when the ratio is equally far between the exchange ratios proposed by the two parties. In the example it would be 90/40</u>.

<u>EUGEN BOHM-BAWERK (1851-1914)</u>

Bohm-Bawerk was an Austrian economist famous for having introduced a dynamic theory of capital formation. <u>He was the first to consider the production process and capital goods in their temporal dimension.</u> According to Bohm-Bawerk, the prices of original productive factors - land and labour – are linked to their marginal productivity, namely to the marginal contribution given to the production of consumer goods. <u>Their efficiency derives from the time sent in production: to increase efficiency, the time of production must be increased</u>. For instance, by increasing the working hours in away, the worker will produce a greater amount of goods.

Within the temporal dimension in which production is analysed, Bohm-Bawerk elaborated a dynamic theory of capital. <u>According to him, capital is the set of consumer goods produced and consumed during the production process</u>. At the beginning of it, the capitalists sell consumer goods to the holders of productive factors – landowners and workers – in order to have their productive services in return. At the end, the capitalist gets a quantity of consumer goods produced, which is greater than that anticipated to productive factors (comparison with Marx).

<u>The exchange between capitalists and productive factors depends in the different time preferences of economic agents</u>. The capitalists sacrifice a quantity of consumer goods in the present to obtain a larger in the future. On the other hand, landowners and workers prefer to obtain a quantity of consumer goods immediately in the present. The interest rate originates from these inter-temporal preferences. The latter is the advantage of capitalists over workers for having anticipated consumer goods in the production process. In an economic system, the interest rate aims at regulating the length of the production process, the distribution of income and prices.

E.g: If the interest rate is higher, it means that the income distribution is more oriented to capitalists.

The Historical School and Institutionalism: Veblen & Schumpeter

Ever since the <u>early 19th century</u>, economists of various origins have reacted critically to some characteristics first of the classical and, later, of the neoclassical school, in particular:

THE IDEA OF UNIVERSAL LAWS

These are thought to be applicable anytime, anywhere (e.g.: the law of diminishing returns/increasing costs is typical of neoclassical thought).

THE PRESENCE OF PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOUR

This includes self-interest mitigated by sympathy for classical economists, and of optimal resources by agents for neoclassical economists.

THE USE OF Hi-D and Hy-D

Classicists use the Hi-D model, while neoclassicists use the Hy-D model.

The Historical school came into being in Germany in the middle of the <u>19th century</u> thanks to the contributions of Roscher, Liszt, and Institutionalism, which appeared around the <u>20th century</u> in the U.S. thanks to the influence of the Historical school.

<u>The major critical points advanced by these schools is that the economic laws and principles of both classical and neoclassical doctrines apply, at best, under specific historic circumstances and that the institutional frameworks adopted may correspond to a certain stage in the development of some nations, but not of others</u>. Furthermore, the Historical and Institutionalist schools have in common the following points:

REJECTION OF THE IDEA OF UNIVERSAL LAWS

Because economics is too complex and cannot be generalised through universal laws.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CONSTANT CHANGES WITHIN THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM

Economic systems evolve according to an a-priori, ill-defined pattern. This implies that even historical generalisations suggested by classical economists are heroic endeavours.

THE USAGE OF THE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF REASONING

This is the only way to build some economic regularities, but not laws, which wouldn’t be efficacious.

<u>JOSEPH A. SCHUMPETER (1883-1950)</u>

Schumpeter was an Austrian economist, a student of von Wieser and Bohm-Bawerk. For many years, he was considered a maverick, namely he did not belong to any particular school. <u>Although his writings could be critical of the Historical school, Schumpeter’s work on the role of innovation entrepreneurship, within the framework of a theory on economic development, can be seen as a a continuation of ideas originated by the historical school, especially the work of von Schmoller and Sombart</u>.

His major contribution regarding economics is:

<u>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</u>

<u>Schumpeter gave centrality to the analysis of economic development as classical scholars and Marx had done, while the theory hadn’t been part of the themes elaborated by the neoclassicists</u>: they treated the phenomenon of development marginally through the method of comparative statics, which consisted of starting from a steady equilibrium and evaluating its changes as a consequence of exogenous variables.

Differently, for Schumpeter, <u>development refers to changes in economic activity that are not externally determined, but are due to endogenous forces (=within the system).</u> For this reason, comparative statics cannot be used as a method to account for those changes.  
Schumpeter’s study starts from a situation of a competitive economy in conditions of static equilibrium. In this economy, the economic path always reproduces itself, meaning that <u>it always reproduces the same level of output, and appears as a continuous circular flow</u>. This conditions determine a rate of profit and an interest rate equal to 0. <u>The innovative entrepreneur is the engine that allows the system to become dynamic, since their initiatives break the stationary equilibrium and generate economic development.</u> For this reason, their role is different from the one of the capitalists, who holds the capital.

Schumpeter considered five different forms of innovation:

THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW GOODS

THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW METHOD OF PRODUCTION

THE OPENING OF A NEW MARKET

THE CONQUEST OR DISCOVER OF A NEW SOURCE OF RAW MATERIALS/SEMI-PROCESSED MATERIALS

NEW ORGANISATION OF INDUSTRY

The remuneration of entrepreneurial activity is profit, which derives from innovation. It consists of the amount of money remaining after paying the costs and it is generated by the following process:

The entrepreneur identifies a new production process allowing to reduce costs. Since the condition they find themselves in is the equilibrium one, they do not have profit, but they need purchasing power to carry out the project

The banking system provides the money needed through a loan

Once the sum has been obtained, the entrepreneur introduces the new production process and thus generates profit as the production costs less than that of other companies

The profits allow the entrepreneur to repay the bank loan

Other entrepreneurs imitate the innovation to gain profits and, consequently, competition arises in the economic system

Some companies fail in imitating and are forced to leave the market, while the production costs of all companies that are able to mimic the innovation are lowered

The profit of the innovator and all imitators disappears and the system returns to equilibrium characterised by more efficient production

The process of adaptation to innovation is represented by business fluctuations, namely <u>periods of expansion and recessions</u>. Innovations induce an increase in the level of economic activity creating favourable climate conditions, consisting of <u>the expansion of credits, the increase in prices and income, while prosperity prevails</u>.

Nonetheless, an economic boom generates conditions which turn to be unfavourable to its continued progress. <u>Rising prices deter investment, and the competition of new products with old ones causes business losses, with non-innovative firms forced out of the market. Such failures produce panic and uncertainty in the market, therefore resulting in a phase of economic crisis.</u> The period of depression allows as the economic system to adapt to a new, improved equilibrium position, since this phase assimilates innovations.

<u>The process described does not happen continuously: innovations do not occur uniformly over time, but discontinuously in groups or clusters, for the appearance of one pushes other entrepreneurs to innovate.</u> This is because:

Entrepreneurs are more likely to innovate when others have already done so

The implementation of an innovation in one sector stimulates the innovation process also in other sectors

As the first entrepreneurs innovate, the demand for goods grows and a climate of trust is generated, pushing others to innovate

<u>THORSTEIN VEBLEN I (1857-1929)</u>

Veblen was a US economist and sociologist, considered one of the founders of institutional economics. One of the most important aspect of Veblen’s analysis was his <u>methodology applied to an economic system that he saw as dynamic and constantly changing</u>. To him, anyone adopting a rigid view of the economy and assuming the future would always work the same was doomed to failure. <u>Veblen adopted an evolutionary approach, studying the forces causing economy to change or resit change over time</u>. In his view, therefore, economists should analyse the key process that shape the economy and economic behaviour.

Veblen claimed that consumers’ behaviours are determined by:

BIOLOGICAL NEEDS

CULTURAL FACTORS

INDUSTRIAL FACTORS

GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES

Since institutions are the organisations, social structures, rules, and habits that structure human interactions and the economy, <u>Veblen believed that those should be the economists’ focus, even if the economy is in constant change and agents are regularly concerned with a variety of factors affecting their behaviour</u>. The understating of institutions provides the right instruments to analyse the forces promoting change and the evolution of the economy.

As a result, Veblen’s analysis founded institutional economics, whose core ideas are:

Institutions are the key factors shaping an economy and should be the primary focus of economics.

The economy is constantly changing, and studying the underlying dynamics, shaped by technology and key institutions, provides the best possible understanding of the structure of the economic system, its evolutions, and the possibility of its improvement through effective government policy.

Humans are social beings whose behaviour is shaped fundamentally by the institutions of society and who seek status and power on the basis of their cultural values. This approach implicitly criticises neoclassical economics.

The concept of conspicuous consumption, namely the practice of consumers purchasing and using goods for the purposes of displaying their status to others, is emblematic of Veblen’ sophisticated analysis of how culture and human institutions shape purchasing pattern. <u>All goods have a value or utility, meaning that they are useful to us and improve our well-being.</u> Nevertheless, conspicuous consumption goods also have a display or honorific value. Within this framework, Veblen also elaborates the notion of pecuniary emulation, where people from lower classes imitate culture, habits, and spending to the upper classes to achieve status for themselves.

I<u>n modern, large-scale societies, people tend to try to impress others by wearing expensive items, while social media emphasises these effects.</u> These demonstrates his cultural values and consumption patterns do shift over time: in the modern society, a specific value set seems to be emerging. Since hard work is considered well paid, people associate frenzy with high status.

Keynes and Recent Developments

<u>ECONOMIC CYCLES: BOOMS AND RECESSIONS</u>

From the early <u>1900’s</u> onwards, finance has played a fundamental role in the functioning of economies. Machinery and production facilities became very expensive and required bank loans to be brought in by capitalists. A new middle class also emerged with wealth that could then be invested in the stock and bond market. <u>It was at this point in time that the demand side of the economy started to become more and more influenced by financial markets.</u>

Financial markets are highly unstable when they are influenced by the expectations of economic agents; their variation has an important impact on consumer spending and investments, and thus also on income. <u>In this era, many advanced economies started experiencing periods of booms and crises that were primarily generated by instability within financial markets.</u> Many scholars actually began to wonder about what caused these crises and how to avoid/exit them.

The classical and neoclassical schools, however, had no answers to this pressing question. Income is determined on the supply side, and no over-/under-production crises are possible. Let us remember that Say’s law applied to these schools: supply thus generates its own demand.

For Ricardo, the rates of profit can fall, resulting in the end of the development process, while for Marx, the fall in the rate of profit will result in the end of capitalism. None of these economists can explain the boom and bust phases; <u>to explain the boom and crisis phase, Say’s law must be abandoned</u>.

<u>THE KEYNESIAN SCHOOL</u>

The Keynesian school is a real revolution in the way of understanding how the economy works. <u>For Keynes and all Keynesian economists, it is not supply that generates demand, but demand that generates supply.</u> Firms produce because they know there is demand for their product. If the demand is low they decide to reduce the production. If the demand is high, they decide to increase the production.

<u>JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES (1883-1946)</u>

John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge. Son of a famous professor of logic and economics (John Neville Keynes), restudied mathematics at King’s College, Cambridge. Keynes had written many books that established him as an economist with international reputation.

However, he is mostly known for his book published in <u>1936</u> titled, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”. This book is often seen as the beginning of a revolution in macroeconomic policy. The “General Theory” was widely read and respected as the “bible” of macroeconomics — though perhaps not exactly in the way its author had expected.

The “General Theory” contains few equations, only one diagram, and no mathematical appendix. Its style is thus discursive, which renders the reading of the book enjoyable, but this also sometimes makes it difficult to understand what exactly Keynes intended.

We may say that the “General Theory” displays a general-equilibrium flavour. Keynes’ story, in fact, is very much about the correlations between four markets:

AGGREGATE COMMODITY MARKET

CAPITAL MARKET

MONEY MARKET

LABOUR MARKET

In contrast with Walras’ general equilibrium model, however, <u>in Keynes’ theory, money occupies a fundamental role and, furthermore, one of the four markets, namely the labour market, can be in disequilibrium while the other three are in equilibrium</u>.

The “General Theory” posits quantities that directly influence other quantities, but provides almost no analysis of how these influences pass through modifications of relative prices and individual incentives. This distinguishes Keynes’ approach from that of marginal analysis.

Moreover, one key ingredient of marginal analysis (utility maximisation) plays only a small role in there book. <u>To capture consumer behaviour, Keynes does not consider the maximisation of utility under the budget constraint, but appeals to the existence of a psychological inclination that makes consumers spend only a fixed fraction c of their earnings.</u> This fraction c is called the marginal propensity to consume.

With respect to previous business cycle theories, most notably that of Hayek, the “General Theory” shifts the focus away from inter temporal equilibrium, dynamic processes, and long-run analysis, to focus on simultaneous equilibria in different markets, comparative statics, and short-run analysis.

Keynes provided two distinct explanations as to why he called his theory a general theory:

It considers the economy as a whole

It removes the assumption of Say’s law that characterised the view of marginalists; for Keynes, Say’s law is false, as aggregate demand can be smaller than aggregate supply

The major characteristics and principles of Keynesian economics are:

MACROECONOMIC EMPHASIS

Keynes and his followers concerned themselves with the determinants of the total or aggregate amounts of consumption, saving, income, output, and employment.

DEMAND ORIENTATION

Keynes stressed the importance of effective demand (now called aggregate expenditures) as the immediate determinant of national income, output, and employment. Aggregate expenditures (AE) consist of the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government, and net export spending. Firms collectively produce a level of real output (Y) that they expect to sell. If AE &lt; Y\* (where Y\* is the full-employment level of output), involuntary employment (which occurs when a person is willing to work at the prevailing wage, yet is unemployed) will exist in the economy.

<u>SOME KEY KEYNESIAN PRINCIPLES</u>

INSTABILITY IN THE ECONOMY

According to Keynes, the economy is given to recurring booms and busts because the level of planned investment spending is erratic. Changes in investment plans cause national income and output to change by amounts greater than the initial changes in investment.

Equilibrium levels of investment and saving are achieved through changes in national income, as opposed to changes in the rates of interest.

WAGE AND PRICE RIGIDITY

Keynesians pointed out that wages tend to be inflexible downwards because of such institutional factors as union contracts, minimum wage laws, and implicit contracts. Prices also are sticky downwards; declines in effective demand initially cause reductions in output and employment rather than declines in the price level.

ACTIVE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES

Keynes advocated that the government should intervene actively through appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to promote full employment, price stability, and economic growth.

THE MAIN THEORETICAL TENETS OF THE “GENERAL THEORY”

<u>THE CONSUMPTION FUNCTION</u>

Keynes pointed to a fundamental law that concerned the relationship between consumption and income:

“Men are disposed, as a rule and on the average, to increase their consumption as their income increases, but not by as much as the increase in their income.”

Stated formally, there is a positive functional relationship between consumption (C) and national income (Y):

C = f(Y)

The ratio of the change in consumption to the change in income (marginal propensity to consume c) is positive and less than one:

MPC = c = ΔC/ΔY

This implies that savings (S) also rise with income; it is, too, a positive function of income:

S = f(Y)

Like the MPC, the marginal propensity to save (MPS = s) is greater than zero and less than one:

MPS = s = ΔS/ΔY

Here is a short run consumption function; the curve’s slope (ΔC/ΔY) is the marginal propensity to consume:<img src="media/image16.png" style="width:2.3397in;height:2.13369in" />

<u>INVESTMENT</u>

Keynes defined economic investment as <u>the purchase of capital goods</u>. But what determined investment? Keynes argues that investment, the major component of his theory of effective demand, depends on the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) in relation to the interest rate.

S<u>pecifically, Keynes argues that, when an entrepreneur buys investment goods in reality, he buys the right to a series of future incomes that they expect to earn by selling the product after the subtraction of current expenditures.</u>

Let’s consider a firm who purchases an additional unit of a capital good (i.e., a machine), and let’s supposed that the expected returns are equal to Qi, where I = 1, 2…, n are the years. The MEC is equal to the discount rate r that satisfies the following condition:

Ps = (Q1)/(1 + r) + (Q2)/(1+r)^2 + … + (Qn)/(1+r)^n

<u>For Keynes, investments will continue to the point at which the marginal efficiency of capital is equal to the rate of interest (the cost of borrowing the funds with which to invest).</u> E.g.: if the marginal efficiency of capital is 2.5%, an investment will not occur at an interest rate of 3%, but it will take place at an interest rate of 2%.

The marginal efficiency of capital is highly variable; it fluctuates with every change in people’s expectations of future profits from contemplated investment.

If we were to plot an investment demand curve, we would see the inverse relationship between the rate of interest (i) and the amount of investment (I) for an economy in which all the relevant investment projects have been arrayed in descending order of their marginal efficiencies of capital.

<u>If the market rate of interest is i1, then the amount of investment will be l1. For all investments up to l1, the marginal efficiency of capital exceeds the cost of borrowing, whereas for all investments beyond l1, the cost of borrowing exceeds the marginal efficiency of capital.</u>

<u>LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE</u>

Liquidity preference depends on three motives for holding money:

TRANSACTION MOTIVE

The need for cash to pay for current purchases for consumption and business needs.

PRECAUTIONARY MOTIVE

The desire to keep some cash on hand for unforeseen emergencies.

SPECULATIVE MOTIVE

The desire to hold cash while waiting for interest rates to rise, or stock and bond prices to fall, or the general price level to fall.

From all of the above motives, <u>only the demand for money for speculation depends on the rate of interest, whereas the other types of demand for money mainly depend on income.</u>

The crucial element in the analysis of the interest rate determination is the relationship between preference of the public for cash and other remunerative assets, such as bonds. The advantage of holding cash is the flexibility in transactions, whereas the disadvantage is that no interest is earned.

<u>The individual’s decision to possess either cash or bonds would ultimately depend on the comparison between expected and current interest rate.</u> If the rate of interest is very low and the individual expects it to rise, then he will consider it more judicious to hold money rather than bonds.

<u>Thus, there is an inverse relation between the rate of interest and the demand for money. This relation is depicted in the figure below. The demand curve (L) slopes downward, indicating that people will desire to hold more cash at lower interest rates.</u>

The quantity of money supplied depends on the policy of the central bank. The quantity of money supplied is assumed to be independent of the interest rate; hence, the money supply curve in the figure below is vertical:<img src="media/image17.png" style="width:2.45748in;height:2.45748in" />

The equilibrium rate of interest is i1. An increase in the quantity of money would lower the interest rate, unless the public’s liquidity preference was increasing more than the quantity of money.

<u>An important point emerges here: a lower rate of interest does not reduce saving, as the classical and neoclassical economists assumed. Instead, it stimulated investment spending. If the economy was operating at less than full employment, national income would rise and saving would increase.</u>

In sum, the level of investment in the economy depends on the interaction of:

THE MARGINAL EFFICIENCY OF CAPITAL

THE MARKET RATE OF INTEREST

The market rate of interest ultimately relied on the demand for money, as well as its supply.

<u>EQUILIBRIUM, INCOME, AND EMPLOYMENT</u>

If we ignore the government and international trade, <u>the immediate determinants of income and employment are consumption and investment spending.</u> These two spending components constitute the aggregate expenditures in the economy.

Equilibrium national income occurs where the combined levels of consumption and investment spending equal the current level of income.

Symbolically, this is where:

Y = C + I

Because saving is the difference between income and consumption:

S = Y - C

Solving the two equations provides an alternative condition for equilibrium income:

S = I

The standard textbook presentation of the simple Keynesian model is shown as the figure below (the Keynesian cross model):<img src="media/image18.png" style="width:2.66027in;height:2.20721in" />

<u>The aggregate expenditure curve AE shows the combined level of consumption and investment spending forthcoming at each level of income.</u> The vertical distance between AE and the consumption function C = f(Y) is the level of investment. The vertical distance between the consumption function and the horizontal axis is the level of consumption.

Equilibrium income is Y1, because at this point, the aggregate expenditures curve crosses the 45° line, indicating that C + I equals to the existing level of income, Y1 (the height of the 45° line at Y1 is equal to the horizontal distance OY1).

How might a depression occur? Keynes answer its easily demonstrated through a simple model. Let’s suppose that the income level in Y1 in the figure above is the full employment level of income. Let’s further assume that, for some reason, entrepreneurs become pessimistic about future business prospects, and that this results in a downward revision of expected returns on a new investment. <u>This translates to a decline in the marginal efficiency of capital and a leftward shift of the investment demand curve.</u>

The decline in investment spending reduces aggregate expenditures from AE1 to AE2; in response to declining sales and rising inventories, firms reduce their employment and production. National income therefore declines from Y1 to Y2:<img src="media/image19.png" style="width:3.30172in;height:3.08397in" />

It should be noted that the equilibrium income declines by more than the drop in investment itself. The reason for this is the multiplier effect of an initial change in investment spending.

Keynes borrowed this theory from R.F. Kahn, a Cambridge colleague of his, and incorporated it directly into his own model. <u>The multiplier measures the ultimate effect on income of a change in spending; it is the change in income divided by the change in investment.</u>

The size of the multiplier depends on the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve (c). Let us assume that c is 0.6. If people’s income falls by 10$, they reduce consumption and investment by 60$ and 40$, respectively.

T<u>he decline in consumption spending of 6$ will cause a further reduction of income of 6$, which in turn will reduce someone else’s consumption spending by an additional 3.6$. Saving will decline by another 2.4$.</u>

This process will continue. Once the total decline in income reaches 25$, equilibrium will be restored. The 25$ decline in income will reduce saving by an amount just equal to the initial 10$ reduction in investment spending (0.4 x 25). In this case, the multiplier is 2.5:

(1)/(1-c) = 1/s = 1/0.4 = 2.5

<u>POLICIES TO PROMOTE FULL EMPLOYMENT AND STABILITY</u>

Keynes proposed a large government role to stabilise the economy at a full employment level of national income. E.g.: <u>the government should stimulate private investment during a period of depression by forcing down the interest rate, which could be accomplished through a central bank policy, But there are limits to how low interest rates will fall.</u>

A second and more effective way to overcome depression is for the government to undertake an expansionary fiscal policy. Government spending, like private investment, serves as a source of aggregate expenditures. Such spending, declared Keynes, could be increased, thereby increasing aggregate expenditures and producing a multiple increase in national income.

<u>KEYNESIANISM</u>

Soon after the publication of the “General Theory”, people began to speak of the “Keynesian Revolution”, and 35 years later, even the president of the president of the U.S. (Nixon) claimed that “we are all Keynesians now”.

Keynesianism split into various lines of thinking and went completely out of fashion in the <u>1970’s</u> and <u>1980’s</u>. When it came back as New Keynesianism in the <u>1990’s</u>, it was in rather different shapes.

In <u>1936</u>, the Econometric Society organised a meeting in Oxford to discuss the “General Theory”. At this meeting, Hicks, Meade, and Roy Hared presented three papers that attempted to translate the “General Theory”’s theoretical core into a system of equations.

Hick’s contribution, titled “Mr. Keynes and the ‘Classics’: a suggested interpretation”, introduced the IS-LM model, which is constituted of four equations:

I = I(i, Y)

This equation states that investments I depend (negatively) on the interest rate i and (positively) on the output Y.

S = S(i, Y)

This equation states that savings S depend (positively) on the interest rate i and (positively) on the output Y.

Md = k x Y + L(i)

The equation says that demand for money Md is given by the demand for transaction purposes k x Y and the liquidity preference L. In Hick’s equation, L depends (negatively) on the interest rate i.

Ms = M

The equation states that the supply of money Ms is exogenously given at the level M decided by the central bank.

In Hick’s model, the IS function is given by the combinations of interest rate i and output Y such that the aggregate investments I and aggregate saving S are equal, i.e., such that S = I.

<u>The LM function is given by the combinations of i and Y, such that the aggregate demand for money Md and aggregate supply of money Ms are equal (Md = Ms).</u>

Macroeconomic equilibrium is then defined as <u>that combination of interest and income at which the IS curve intersects the LM curve</u>. Depending on the slopes and positions of the curves, IS-LM equilibrium can be a full-employment equilibrium (Y\*) or an underemployment equilibrium (Y0).

For Hicks, IS-LM analysis served to show that both the key features of Keynes’ “General Theory” and the standard approach of neoclassical economics could be captured by one and the same model.

<u>Keynes had considered his theory to be incompatible with neoclassical theory. Hick’s synthetical model conflicted with hat view, but Keynes did not protest.</u> The IS-LM model, labeled “neoclassical synthesis” by Samuelson, presented the neoclassical full-employment equilibrium as the benchmark case and reduced the theoretical domain of Keynes to 3 specific cases in which underemployment equilibria could develop from:

A LIQUIDITY TRAP

This is a situation in which the interest elasticity of money demand and hence the market rate of interest are too high to be compatible with full employment; it is illustrated buy the horizontal part of the LM0 curve. In that situation, neither a reduction in the price level nor an autonomous increase in the money supply will lead to a lower rate of interest and higher effective demand.

AN INVESTMENT TRAP

An investment trap is a situation in which investment does not respond to any changes in the rate of interest. Profit expectations may be too pessimistic, and hence the marginal efficiency of capital too low, to induce sufficient investment.

RIGID WAGES AND PRICES

Liquidity and investment traps can actually be avoided through public spending, as recommended by Keynes.

<u>As time went by, however, the functional relationships of the IS-LM analysis were revised in terms of micro theoretical models that cast doubts on the relevance of liquidity and investment traps</u>. Franco Modigliani, James Tobin, William Baumol, and Don Patinkin, all working at different universities in the U.S., were the main contributors to these “microfoundations” of the synthesis.

T<u>he traps were reduced to mere possibilities; and even if they developed, they were not likely to persist for more than a very short period.</u> Hence, wage and price rigidities seemed to offer the last and only route to the explanation of underemployment equilibria.

In the <u>1950’s-1960’s</u>, the IS-LM model was thought of as a correct representation of the problem of business cycles. Economists disagreed only with respect to the values of the parameters of the model.

This model allowed for the analysis of various effects of combinations of fiscal and monetary policies on the level of national income and employment. <u>One of the most important problems of the model is that out does not explain the general level of prices.</u>

In the <u>1960’s</u>, the IS-LM model was supplemented with the Philllips curve as a tool of explaining the level of prices in the economy. <u>The Phillips curve is a single-equation empirical model, named after William Phillips, describing a historical inverse relationship between rates of unemployment and corresponding rates of rises in wages that result within an economy</u>. Under certain assumptions, the original Phillips curve could be interpreted to indicate a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

The Phillips curve gave another powerful argument for government interventionism — it suggested that you can control at least one important macro variable, A.K.A., inflation or unemployment. <u>IS-LM and the Phillips curve were basic elements of the neoclassical synthesis that turned out to be the most popular interpretation of Keynes’ “General Theory”.</u>

The IS-LM model was rejected in macroeconomics in the <u>1970’s</u>. There were various problems with it:

It does not accurately explain inflation

It is not formulated in terms of the general equilibrium (GE) model

<u>COUNTER-REVOLUTIONS</u>

The counter-reaction to the Keynesian revolution began in the <u>1950’s/1960’s</u> with Milton Friedman’s “The Quantity Theory: A Restatement”. Friedman’s critique of Keynesianism was based on a micro theoretical reinterpretation of both Keynesian and quantity theory. <u>He argued that the quantity theory was essentially a theory of money demand, and not merely a hypothesis about price-level determination.</u>

Monetarists made three major contributions to scientific economics:

MONEY SUPPLY AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF BUSINESS CYCLES

This states that movements in the money supply have been the primary cause of business fluctuations, and that movements in aggregate demand for goods has relatively little impact.

NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT HYPOTHESIS

This is the belief that there exists a unique rate of unemployment that is associated with non-accelerating inflation and that, in the long run, the economy will settle at such an unemployment rate.

SUPERIORITY OF MONETARY POLICY RULES

This is the assertion that monetary policy is much more effective than fiscal policy in fighting business cycles; following a steady money supply growth rule is, at least in the long run, better than a discretionary, counter-cyclical monetary policy.

Strict monetarism actually died out in the <u>1980’s</u> for 3 main reasons:

You cannot control money supply

Some empirical studies show that money is able to exert a significant and persistent influence on real variables

No basis in microeconomic theory

The monetarists interpreted non-neutralities of money as short-run phenomena that result from the interaction of inappropriate monetary policy and “frictions” in the market process.

The frictions were mainly expressed as time lags in adjustments of expectations to actual changes in the price level. Those lags were captured by the hypothesis of adaptive expectations, which states that people form their expectations about future inflation by taking into account their earlier errors. <u>The adaptive expectation hypothesis soon came under attack by new classical critics.</u>

Robert Lucas and Thomas Sargent demanded that all economic theory must be firmly based on the rigorous micrcofoundations of Walrasian GE theory assuming rational expectations in representative actor models. They formed the so-called new classical economics school.

<u>All changes in the levels of production and employment should be explained as results of rational behaviour under the assumptions of full price flexibility and continuous market clearing.</u>

New classical economists considered adaptive expectations to be inconsistent with rational behaviour, as they are backward-looking and systematically erroneous. Since markets are assumed to maximise utility or profit, they will make use of all accessible information about future developments in markets and in economic policy. Their expectations are forward-looking and rational in the sense that all systematic errors will be eliminated in the search for utility and profit gains.

<u>Given these assumptions, only a completely erratic, unpredictable type of monetary policy could be non-neutral with regard to unemployment.</u> No systematic monetary policy has any real influence on the economy. New classical economics attempted to explain business cycles as responses to monetary shocks/as changes to aggregate supply in reaction to unforeseeable inflationary impulses. <u>Even this last vestige of non-neutrality of money was eliminated by the next round of new classical economics.</u>

Real Business Cycle (RBC) theory, introduced by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott, developed from new classical macroeconomics, which declined in the <u>mid-1980’s</u>. In their paper “Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations” (<u>1982</u>), Prescott and Kydland took the Walrasian imperative seriously, of explaining observed fluctuations of macroeconomic variables exclusively from changes in the fundamental data of tastes and technology.

<u>They and other RBC theorists modelled business cycles as optimal responses to technology shocks and unforeseeable shifts in preferences.</u> In the RBC approach, money is completely neutral, irrelevant for the explanation of changes in production and employment.

Since technological shocks in RBC theory are random, they are unpredictable by the government, and there is no role for the government in fighting business cycles. <u>The economy is continuously adjusting in an optimal way to changing technology, and both monetary and fiscal policies are unable to reduce fluctuations in technology and output; these policies are costly and will only reduce welfare.</u>

Thus, in macroeconomic policy, we have a radically anti-interventionist approach, but the RBC theory has been criticised by many:

There is no evidence that depressions are cased by technological regress

In RBC models, unemployment is absent or a result of voluntary choices of economic agents, who adjust to changing technology; but it is hard to treat unemployment as such in times such as the Great Depression

Evidence suggests that money is not neutral in the short run

Empirical evidence in support of RBC theory was found to her “too fragile to be believable”

<u>NEW KEYNESIANS</u>

In the <u>mid-1980’s</u>, there was a revival of Keynesian economics. Several new Keynesian-like theories and models appeared and new Keynesian economics (NKM) as a school of macroeconomic thinking was established.

In the late <u>1980’s</u> and <u>1990’s</u>, this school was engaged in a heated debate with a new classical Macro and RBC School on the nature of business cycles and proper policies to fight them.

NKM agreed with all “old” Keynesian propositions, such as:

An unregulated market economy will exhibit involuntary unemployment equilibrium

Business cycles are caused by aggregate demand fluctuations

“Money matters” —&gt; monetary policy can be effective in fighting depressions

Government intervention has the potential to improve macroeconomic stability

But NKM models are also very different from Keynesian economics of the <u>1960’s</u> because NKM shares two premises of new classical macro:

Use microfoundations from GE theory

Assume rational expectations

With those assumptions, NKM models provide different explanations of business cycles than new classical macro and RBC theory.

There are dozens of approaches in NKM to explain the business cycle that focus on different causes:

NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITY

Wages do not change in a flexible way; in such a situation, monetary policy can have real effects.

NOMINAL PRICE RIGIDITY

Changing prices is costly (menu prices), and thus prices are not always changed when demand or cost of production changes; New Keynesians have shown that such menu costs can produce large macroeconomic fluctuations.

REAL PRICE RIGIDITIES

Real (not nominal) prices do not change in a flexible way.

REAL WAGE RIGIDITIES

Real wages are not flexible and cannot be easily lowered for various reasons.

<u>But since NKM agree that some business cycles are irregular and unpredictable, new Keynesians are not enthusiastic supporters of government management of the economy characteristic of the “old” Keynesians.</u> They see a need for government action, especially during big recessions. They support limited discretionary governmental acts.

<u>CONCLUSIONS</u>

Agreement that business cycle theories (BCT) should possess GE microfoundations

Agreement on methods used to verify BCT

Agreement that monetary policy can have systematic real effects in the short run

Disagreement on whether active governmental management of demand can help the economy to adjust in the short run

In the early 1990’s, however, all those problems suddenly became less interesting for macroeconomists
