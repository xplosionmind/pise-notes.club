### Mainstream Econnomics

Economics is the science of studying human behavior as the relationship between **given ends** and **scarce means**.
It focuses on the behavior of singular economic agents in their attempt to make <u>the best use of available resources</u>. Choices made by individuals follow the **rationality criterion**: everybody is able to compare costs and benefit according to a scenario of limited alternatives, with the aim of maximizing benefits and minimizing losses.  
Society is defined as <u>the aggregate of individual behavior</u>.

### Heterodox Economics

Economics is the study of social economic activities generating **an array of surpluses** of goods and services needed to <u>sustain social individuals and the society as a whole</u>. According to this definition, social economic activities are something related to an **evolving process**: the activities of production in a given period depends on the epoch. Moreover, such activities are all <u>entangled with other social aspects</u> such as culture, norms, beliefs, and religion.

Essentially, ME is considered **static**, while HE appears to be a more **dynamic** interpretation of Economics. <u>The ultimate distinction</u> between the two <u>lays in their approach to studying the economy</u>.

## Methodology

### Terminology

Before diving into the methodologies of investigating economic events, it is important to define some terminology:

- a **phenomenon** is a fact or an event observed in reality
- a **theory** is a scientific explanation of one or more phenomena. The **explanation power** of a theory is the range of phenomena it is able to explain . For instance, a theory capable of explaining a “business cycle” is better than one able to explain recession, for the former has more explanation power than the other (???). The **domain** of a theory is the <u>position of reality</u> within which it works. This enables to distinguish general and specific theories.
- a **model** an instrument to synthesize a theory. Models can be:
	1. **humanistic**: verbal discussion
	2. **visual**: graphical presentation
	3. **analytical**: mathematical and algebrical representation

<br>

### Deductive method

The deductive method starts from very <u>general premises or assumptions</u>, which can result from our mental elaboration (abstract statements) or from the observation of historical facts. Subsequently, conclusions are drawn by means of <u>logical reasoning</u>.  
The kind of premises distinguishes two genres of deductive methods:
- the **Hypothetical-deductive** method
- the **Hystorical-deductive** method

#### Drawbacks

- conclusions are valid iff the general premises are true
- independent from time and space: any change in one of the two cannot be taken into account
- general assumptions/premises are too abstract: conclusions are unable to explain all of the important parts of reality, therefore they explain a limited portion of it.

<br>

### Inductive method

The inductive method starts <u>from particular facts</u> and, by means of empirical experiments, <u>it produces general conclusions</u>.

#### Drawbacks

- induction requires several iterations and tests
	- **time** consuming
	- **expensive**, since tests have a cost
- data collection is not always simple or straightforward
- results can be misinterpreted
