## Economics: definitions and methods

### Mainstream Econnomics

Economics is the science of studying human behavior as the relationship between **given ends** and **scarce means**.
It focuses on the behavior of singular economic agents in their attempt to make <u>the best use of available resources</u>. Choices made by individuals follow the **rationality criterion**: everybody is able to compare costs and benefit according to a scenario of limited alternatives, with the aim of maximizing benefits and minimizing losses.  
Society is defined as <u>the aggregate of individual behavior</u>.

### Heterodox Economics

Economics is the study of social economic activities generating **an array of surpluses** of goods and services needed to <u>sustain social individuals and the society as a whole</u>. According to this definition, social economic activities are something related to an **evolving process**: the activities of production in a given period depends on the epoch. Moreover, such activities are all <u>entangled with other social aspects</u> such as culture, norms, beliefs, and religion.

Essentially, ME is considered **static**, while HE appears to be a more **dynamic** interpretation of Economics. <u>The ultimate distinction</u> between the two <u>lays in their approach to studying the economy</u>.
