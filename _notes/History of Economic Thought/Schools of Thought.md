## Scolasticism

This school developed in the XII century and lasted up to the XVI century. Its approach was Hypothetical-deductive, and its general prescriptions were the Christian ones, thus <u>natural laws deriving from God</u>.

The main theorist of Scholasticism was Thomas Aquinas. He focused two ideas:
- A **just price** is considered to be a price which is not changed by external factors
- Money is a **medium**, therefore it is an unnatural custom to borrow and lend it: **usury** is wrong

## Pre-classical school

- [Mercantilism] ([William Petty])
- [Phisiocracy] (Quesnay)

From the XVI to XIX century, increasing level of knowledge, a rise of the inductive approach, supported by [[Francis Bacon]], who influenced [William Petty]’s ideas. It is a market-based economical system.

## Mercantilism

Characterized on big nations which establish contracts with merchants. The main scholars were merchants, interested in maximizing the accumulation of gold and silver. The best method for gaining wealth was trade, which benefited countries in two ways:
- <u>importation from colonies</u> (no money flows)
- Export of goods to other countries (earning money)

### First period

1500s to 1650s: great import of goods and the increase of their price. J. Bodin studied this effect, and introduced ***the quantity theory of money***:

$$
\overbrace{M^{\uparrow} \cdot{} V}^\text{expense capacity}
=
\underbrace{P^{\uparrow} \cdot{} y}_\text{nominal level of output}
$$

Where:
- $M$: Quantity of money
- $V$: velocity of circulation of money, given by the average number of transactions (may be considered as fixed, since it depends on the customs of a country’s population)
- $P$: price of the final products
- $y$: quantity of the final products

Since $V$ and $y$ are stable over time, if $M$ grows, necessarily the price increases accordingly.  
Bodin’s idea is that if we increase the input, we +++

### Second period

1650s to 1750s: reduction in import of raw resources. The solution to this scarcity is </u>exporting goods</u>, therefore, $y$ grows and its price lowers.

$$
M ^{\uparrow} \cdot{} V
=
P ^{\downarrow} \cdot{} y ^{\uparrow}
$$

Such formula has been outlined by John Law and William Petty
