The period of time between Smith and Ricardo was a transitional phase characterized by <u>relevant changes</u> both in the main economic themes and in the way of analyzing them.

The **French Revolution** enhanced the need for increasingly liberal policies, and the following years were marked by frequent crises of the agricultural sector, particularly in Great Britain.

Therefore, the main topics tackled by Post-Smithian thinkers are ***laissez faire*** and **crisis management**.
