[Thomas Robert Malthus] (1766-1834) was an English economist, philosopher and demographer. His last field of interest particularly integrates with his study of Economics, since he fosuces particularly on population.

## Population

Malthus’ claim is that <u>the growth of population dooms society to poverty</u>. From this, two distinct processes follow:

<br>

### Arithmetical growth of the agricultural production

Arithmetical growth of the agricultural production results from the presence of limits to the available lands and diminishing returns.

#### Law of diminishing returns

Less output is produced as more people work on the same amount of land

<br>

### Geometrical growth of the population

Geometrical growth of the population is the result of **human sex drive**. According to Malthus, population growth can be checked in two ways:
1. **preventive checks** <u>reduce the birth rate</u> by means of moral restraints such as family planning, late marriages and celibacy.
2. **positive checks** increase the death rate; they naturally arise when the population increases greatly. Some examples could be natural disasters, pandemics or wars.

If both these checks do not work, the population enters a phase of misery, since <u>resources will not be enough for everyone</u>.

In the case of increase in poverty, according to Malthus <u>governments should not promote policies in support of the poor</u>: doing so would foster early marriages and consequently a further population growth.

## Wages and rents

According to Malthus, income $y$ is distributed among wages $W$, rents $R$ and profits $\Pi$, therefore among classes.

$$
y = W + R + \Pi
$$

$W = L \cdot w_s$, where $w_s$ is the subsistence wage rate: the total wages barely sufficient to guarantee the workers’ reproduction.

Malthus strongly justified the landowners’ income ($R$), because, in the long run, it grows due to the scarcity of fertile land. This idea is strictly related to Malthus’ theory of market glut, which connects to Ricardo’s theories.

<br>

### Market Glut Theory

It is based on three important assumptions concerning social class behavior:
- Workers consume all of their $w_s$ for necessary needs
- Landowners consume their income to purchase luxury goods which are unproductive
- Capitalists use their profit $\Pi$ to increase the accumulation of capital through investments.

$$
y = \underbrace{L \cdot w_s}_\text{workers’ consumption} + \underbrace{T \cdot r}_\text{landowners’ consumption} + \underbrace{K \cdot \pi}_\text{investments}
$$

If profits increase in relation to wages, then workers’ incomes will not be able to provide a level of aggregate demand sufficient to match the value of the goods produced by them: <u>workers’ income cannot buy back the total output</u>.

It is generated a lack of aggregate demand, which can be extinguished by introducing **higher rents**, so that the missing demand is satisfied with luxury goods bought from landowners.  
This is the reason why Malthus favored rents: they help supporting the demand. Corn laws pushed in the same direction, by redistributing incomes from profits to rents.

#### Problem

Even without refusing Say’s Law, Malthus omits the capitalistic investments when analyzing the demand. With rising profits, regardless of the amount of wages, <u>there cannot be a shortage of demand in the capitalistic market</u>.
