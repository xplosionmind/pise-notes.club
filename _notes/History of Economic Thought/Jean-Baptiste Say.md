[Jean-Baptiste Say] (1767 - 1832) was a French economist.

## Theory of Value

Since Say’s concept of value conflicted with Smith’s Theory of value, the latter was rejected by the French thinker. Say maintained a subjective theory where the basis for value is utility, hence the capability of a good or service to meet some human desire. <u>The value of a commodity and its production depend on how potential customers evaluate it</u>, the prices of goods and services reflect their utility to buyers. The monetary value of a commodity is defined by Say as **current price**.

## Income distribution

According to Say, labor, capital, and land are the three types of **productive services** required by the production of goods.

The use of such services <u>must be compensated for by their employment availability</u>. The remuneration of the final good equals the one of the production factors, hence <u>the value of output independently determined in the market goes entirely to the owners of the productive services</u>.

## Say’s Law

Assuming that people spend all their money insofar as they are not interested in accumulating it, Say’s Law states that <u class='thick'>the sum of all distributed revenues is equal to to that of the value of total output</u>: to produce a good means to <u>create a demand</u> of equal value through the revenues of the owner of the three productive services.

<div class="box">
	People produce commodities and sell them <strong>to earn money</strong>&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;Nobody wants to hold onto money since doing so <u>would make its value fall</u>, thus&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;people swap money for other products they want.&emsp;&rarr;&emsp;<strong>supply creates its own denand</strong>
</div>

A consequence of Say’s Law is that, if supply creates an equal value for demand, <u>there is no room for <strong>overproduction</strong></u> in the entirety of the economy.

It follows that Smith’s liberalism is overcome: market forces always lead to equilibrium, and the government has no role in the correction of imbalances, which are not created because of market competition and the non-accumulation of money.

This law has been the core of a conflict between Classical and Keynesian economists:
- according to Classical economists, the **supply** is the most important part of the economy to achieve growth.
- according to Keynesian economists, instead, the **demand** is the most important part of the economy in order to obtain growth
