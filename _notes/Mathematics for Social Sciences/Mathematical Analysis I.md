Since [professor Silvio Mercadante](https://www.disma.polito.it/en/personale/scheda/(nominativo)/silvio.mercadante "Silvio Mercadante on Politecnico di Torino's website") from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) kindly releases his classes' slides under the [Creative Commons ShareAlike License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/), I thought they might as well be useful for PISE students attending Maths classes.

The following is a link to a folder containing all slides.
