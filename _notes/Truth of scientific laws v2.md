## Why scientific laws?

Laws lie visavis real phenomena, but they can handle ideal phenomena

Why then laws are so important, and to Hempel are at the cernter of the discussion?

Because they provide us with an explanation. Nevertheless, such laws must be true, or data they provide aren't reliable.

## Truth of Scientific laws

It may be about
- a matter of logic
- a matter of how they portray what goes on in the real world

Then logic alone can't succeed in defining laws.

Try to describe what **actually** goes on in science, what happens, in order to understand the an explanation.

The key question is: if a law expresses a regularity, what explains the regularity itself?

We infer what we may call empirical regularities from laws of broader and broader scope. +++

The example of Newton's law of gravitation: *gravitation* is the name Newton gave to a force which we can't directly observe:   
***if*** Newton's law is true, ***then*** certain correlations can be explained

What does the explaining is the actual inference.

A complete view:

+++

the ultimate value of a theory is dependent from the degree of generalization. From empirical data to laws always more abstract and general.

+++ grasping where explanatory power lies

The way I explain an inference is always the same.

## Problems of Hempel's view

### Fist problem

The very idea of explanation

why is it that –e.g.– some materials are affected by some 

+++

Example of the two descriptions / formulations of Newton's gravitational law.

We don't only state the correlation, we account for it.

Pushing the boundaries: going well beyond the logical understanding. 

### Second problem

The model of theory in this account. A theory is +++ FROM SLIDES

> if a body were free of forces, it would move at constant velocity

Logic isn't enough: in the real world there are no object which can be free of forces!

So scientific theories are ontological maps of the inner constitution of the world; they should explain why phenomena behave the way they do at the observable level.

It follows that theories become very risky devices: they might discover entities that turn out not to exist
