[[Truth of scientific laws v2]] +++

Once we have a law, we have an explanation, but we need to trust the laws from which such explanation it's provided in order to rely on it.

Two currents which face each other:
- logical and prescriptive explanations
- extra-logical and descriptive explanations

If a law expresses a regularity, what explains the regularity itself?
- a matter of logic
- a matter of portraying what goes on in the real world

<br>

## General laws

Hempel: we infer empirical regularities from laws of gradually broader scope. Such laws are general because they're more comprehensive.

Example of Newton's law of gravitation:\
it can't be observed, but several empirical instances are explained by inferring to a general law which, if accepted, makes sense of such phenomena. What does the explanation is the inference to a broader and more general law, not the law itself.

Different degrees of explanatory power are displayed by the same explanatory inference, which is both deductive and nomological.

### Problems

1. The very idea of explanation
2. The model of theory entailed in this idea of explanation
3. The role of hypotheses

They start as separate problems, but they converge to a greater unique one.

<br>

### First problem

How can we correlate, to trace back, an instance to a law?

+++ and ???


Newton's example: two similar explanations with a critical difference:\
- <q>Every object in the Universe attracts every other object with a force which is proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the square of the separation between the centers of mass of the two objects</q>
- <q>A “universal” force of gravitation *F* exists between any two masses *m* and *M*, directed from one to the other, proportional to each of them and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance *r*</q>

It is the very existence of the force which accounts for the observation. We are conjecturing the existence of theories and object well beyond logical boundaries ([[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]] ???)

A different type of explanation: an entity which explains what we see. Postulated entities often can't be observed. they seem to explain very well what goes on, but they haven't enough empirical data in their support.

There is more to science than logic: sentences used to describe the world through laws are simpler than the actual structure of the world.

Theories should instead be ontological maps of the inner constitution of the world, explaining why phenomena behave in the way they do at the observable level. Laws postulate what's actually out there in the universe waiting for a experimentation to prove or reject it.

### Third problem

[[Karl Popper|Popper]]: we can only test our conjectures whn we have them, by using a ***hypothetico-deductive method***; the same goes with Hempel:


The role of theories and hypotheses in this model: how do we account for the discovery of hypotheses?

From Popper's point of view, the procedure to follow. +++

#### The hypotetico-deductive model
1. Observation (*O*)
2. Hypothesis formulation (*H*)
3. deduction of a consequence to the hypotheses (*if H, then p*)
4. Empirically check the validity of the conclusion (*p?*)
5. if the conclusion is proven to be not true, also the hypothesis will be not true. (*!p, !H*)

Logic doesn't care about how the hypotheses is brought about, but they focus on the testing:

> The initial stage, the act of conceiving or inventing a theory, seems to me neither to call for logical analysis nor to be susceptible of it. The question how it happens that a new idea occurs to a man… may be of great interest to empirical psychology; but it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of scientific knowledge.

<p class="cite"><cite>Logic of Scientific Discovery</cite>, p.20</p>

Hempel agrees with Popper on this

> The transition from data to theory requires <u>creative imagination</u>. Scientific hypotheses and theories are not *derived* from observed facts, but *invented* in order to account for them. They constitute guesses at the connections that might obtain between phenomena \[…\]. “Happy guesses” of this kind require great ingenuity, especially if they involve a radical departure from current modes of scientific thinking \[…\]

Guesses and the connection we might obtain from phenomena, invent hypotheses.

At this point, Hempel disagrees with Popper:\
testing doesn't mean falsification
- if a hypothesis is not true, it's not false, but ***disconfirmed***
- if an hypotheses is not (not falsified), it is not true, it is ***confirmed***.

> even extensive testing with entirely favourable results does not establish a hypotheses conclusively, but provides only more or less strong support for it. Hence, \[…\] it \[scientific enquiry\] may be said to be inductive in a wider sense, inasmuch as it involves the acceptance of hypotheses on the basis of data that afford no deductively conclusive evidence, but lend it more or less strong ‘inductive support’ or confirmation

<p class="cite">Hempel, <cite>Philosophy of Natural Science</cite>, p.18</p>

## Testing the hypotheses

Mixed reasoning:
- inference from an hypotheses to a p is deductive
- inference from the truth of p to the truth of H is inductive

### The problem of auxiliary assumptions

- the consequent doesn't follow from the hypotheses alone
- the role of *auxiliary assumptions*

+++

#### The Duhem-Quine problem

##### The *holistic* view

We aren't testing individual theories and hypotheses, but a whole set of ad-hoc assumptions, auxiliary hypotheses, etc.

Theories are not just logical structures, but ontological maps of the world.

To Hempel, we may also use induction, even if this doesn't mean that the hyp will be true for sure, it can only be confirmed.

### The raven Paradox

A paradox of relevance, of using relevance for testing.

It comes from two main ideas:
- **instance confirmation**, [Nicod's principle](+++)   
> +++ FROM SLIDES
- **equivalence condition**: logically equivalent statements are confirmed by the same evidence

thus

1. <q>all ravens are black</q>, which is logically equivalent to
2. <q>everything that is not black is not a raven</q>

But in here it lies a contradiction: the more black ravens I see, the more I prove statement `1`, but according to the equivalence condition, even collecting data which confirms the second statement would also confirm the first one, which is absurd.

We're assuming a world where everything is either a black raven, or is not a raven.

The world is divided in
- ~~not black ravens~~
- black ravens
- non ravens

non black non ravens

If we observe a green chair, it tells us nothing about ravens, it's not relevant, nevertheless, it's considered valuable for the equivalence condition.

From Goodman:

<br>

Back to the hypothetical- deductive model:

does this describe how scientists conduct their work?

[[Semmelwise]]

## A different type of reasoning

Inferring **to** the hypotheses: inference to the best explanation.

> +++

## Lipton, Inference to the Best Explanation

+++ link to Lipton

Semmelwise to him reasoned in IBE, not H-D.

Underlying this idea of IBE, is the logical move of trying to understand if we can infer *to* an hypotheses before inferring *from* an hypotheses.

[[Peirce]]

How did Kepler arrive to his first law?

> +++

The H-D method accounts to the process pursued after having an hypotheses, how to "**catch**" it instead.

## Criticisms of abduction

Abduction cannot be a logic of discovery, because the hyp is already included (or supposed to be known) in the premises

we can locate abduction between discovery and testing


## Inference to the *best* hypotheses

2020-12-03

Two problematic areas:
- how to formulate sci hyp
- how we come to postulate the entities we use in sci laws in order to explain what we observe at an empirical level

We often infer the existence of such entities +++

Looking at scientific theories in terms of postulates we're not basing our theories of something not sure; nevertheless if these theories work they are a satisfactory result anyway.

How do we know what we call “electron” etc. is actually what we see in the world?

How do we explain that electrons and quarks are actually “natural kinds”?
