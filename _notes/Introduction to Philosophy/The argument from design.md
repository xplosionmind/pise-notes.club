From an actual historical perspective, instead, Epicurus was condemned because he sustained that humanyty can' **access** God's domain +++. At Hume's time, being an Epicurean meant to be labeled as an atheist.

Hume uses the form of the dialogue to discuss this argument, the interlocutore+++ is a friend.

+++ up until the idea that having no God makes free

This thought was expressed in <cite>The Karamazov Brothers</cite> and sustained by Pierre Bayle: he wrote a dictionary, a sort of Encyclopedia on every argument discussed in his time; he considered a possibility of an atheist society.

Hume imagines an apology, a speech, made by Epicurus to defend his thought.

The dialogue

A teleological *a posteriori* argument. The idea of an **order**. From the watch, we need to find the watch maker

According to the dialogue's Epicurus.

It must exist a proportion from the effect to the cause. It's not rational to attribute more attributes to the effect than to the cause
