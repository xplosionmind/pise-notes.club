Up to early modern philosophy, there has been a clear distinction between the two:

The mind was conceived as the substance; consciousness was the activity performed by the mind the source of principles, reasoning and beliefs, or better the ontological meaning of the former.

In contemporary Philosophy, though, they're considered synonyms.

Descartes was the first to identify the terms “mind and consciousness”, in the <cite>Meditations</cite>.   
Furthermore, Locke was the first English speaking philosopher to attribute an identity between consciousness and mind.
