Up to early modern philosophy, there has been a clear distinction between the terms “mind” and “consciousness”\
- <u>mind was conceived as the substance</u>;
- <u>consciousness was the activity</u> performed by the mind the source of principles, reasoning and beliefs, or better the ontological meaning of the former.

In contemporary Philosophy, though, <u>they're considered synonyms</u>.

Descartes was the first to identify the terms “mind” and “consciousness”, in the <cite>Meditations on First Philosophy</cite>.\
Locke was the first English speaking philosopher to attribute an identity between consciousness and mind.
