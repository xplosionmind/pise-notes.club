David Hume was born in Edinburgh, from a poor family. he was supposed to study law, which he hated. In the '30s he started to systematically study Philosophy. Because of the intensity and excitement of his intellectual discovery, he had a nervous breakdown in 1729.  In 1734, he came to the turning point of his life and retired to France for three years. Most of this time he spent at La Flèche on the Loire, studying and writing *A Treatise of Human Nature*. The Treatise was Hume’s attempt to formulate a full-fledged philosophical system. It is divided into three books:

1. Book I, “Of the Understanding,” discusses, in order, the origin of ideas; the ideas of **space and time**; knowledge and probability, including **the nature of causality**; and the skeptical implications of those theories.
2. Book II, “**Of the Passions**,” describes an elaborate psychological machinery to explain the emotional, order in humans and assigns a subordinate role to reason in this mechanism.
3. Book III, on **morals**, characterizes moral goodness in terms of “feelings” of approval or disapproval that people have when they consider human behaviour in the light of agreeable or disagreeable consequences, either to themselves or to others.

Since these books had very little success, he focused on publishing **essays**. Among them, there is *Enquiry on Human Understanding*.

(Essays: Montaigne the first one to use the essay form, but in a more personal way.)

The essay on Human Understanding became a bestseller, and he became rich.

He then moved to France and met Diderot, D'Allembert, Rousseau. He proposed to Rousseau to go to England.

He decided to postpone the publication of the dialogues on human religion

Philosophy should be a science, the science which explains human behavior: the ways in which we feel, we act, we learn. Thus, useful to all sciences, since they all are studied by men.

The main epistemological assumption is **Empiricism**.

### Perceptions

***Perceptions*** are the essence of human relationship with the world (*Enquiry II*).

- **Impressions**: direct and clear products of immediate experience.
- **Ideas**: representations of previous impressions.

No difference between impressions and ideas, only a question of force.

> [4] +++

Principles of association among ideas:

- resemblance;
- contiguity in time or place;
- cause and effect (causality).

There are no rules to know, knowledge simply comes from the direct experience of and in the world.

+++

All of the possible sources of knowledge are

- **relations of ideas**: relationship of ideas not immediately intuitively connected among each other.
- **matters of fact**: propositions which can definitely be denied without contradiction. They describe the situation we can experience in the world, they speak about the world.

We don't have access to the actual essence of the Universe, since we can't experience with our senses the core of reality. It's not a problem, we don't need metaphysics. We don't need to understand the core, we need to understand what we have. It's not important that we impose principles to other people, as we think it's better to think. Be a scientist, try to understand what it's necessary to understand. Descartes is connected 

**+++ quarter to 7**

We don't have proof of objectivity, but different skepticisms.

We can communicate with each other, so we can exchange opinions on everyday life. In normal

We can't say

## Principle of causality

<p class="date">29<sup>th</sup> September 2020</p>

We can't consider all ideas mere copies of impressions. Ideas and impressions are combined by means of imagination. Our imagination doesn't act completely freely, it follows some rules[^1] 

Maths only as an abstraction when we generalize and abstract notions of the single objects we experience.

Platonic point of view (maths is real) vs Aristotelic point of view (maths is an abstraction). Different perspectives: later on every philosopher had to “pick a side”.

### Hume's critic to the principle of cause and effect

The principle of cause and effect is the most important one, since through this we can extend our knowledge of the world we can get through our senses.

*Cause* and *reason* conceived as synonyms at the time. 

How do we know the principle of cause and effect? How do we get the knowledge of it? How do we understand the cause of cause and effect? Why is it the most important principle?

+++ ~45

The certainty of this principle can't come by reasoning only. If we look at an object for the first time, we can't understand its causes and the possible effects.

Sometimes we don't need experience to infer the causes of some events (billiard ball example)
