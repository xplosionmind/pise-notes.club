*Of the Different Species of Philosophy*

<p class="date">28<sup>th</sup> September 2020</p>

<u>Philosophy should be</u> a science, <u>the science which explains human behavior</u>: the ways in which we feel, we act, we learn. Thus, Philosophy is useful to all sciences, since they are all studied by men. A Newtonian definition of science: knowledge has to come from experience; since Philosophy is the science of human nature, it is studied by observing and analyzing human behavior. Philosophy is a descriptions how human beings are.

> we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection \[…\]. And though a philosopher may live remote from business, <u>the genius of philosophy</u>, if carefully cultivated by several, <u>must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society</u>, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling.
