Unlimited freedom is not desirable. Any law, of whatever kind, in itself actually is a limitation of freedom.

We tend to merge the concept of individual liberty with the one of form of government, which are different. Freedom from boundaries can only cause disorder, since it's obvious that the individual freedom ends when the individual freedom of another one starts.

Reference to Kant: I am actually free when my actions follow from laws I rationally give to myself. I'm free because I pursue decisions which I consider rational
