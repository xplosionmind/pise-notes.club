## Life

[René Descartes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/ "René Descartes on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy") on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

He attended the college of La Flèche in France, where he studied a lot of Aristotle.
Understanding the new currents of thought, he <u>graduated in law</u> at the university of Poitier, he then enrolled in the army of [Maurice of Nassau](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prince_of_Orange "Prince of Orange on Wikipedia"). He spent a lot of time in Holland. He started the thirty years war in the protestant army, then, after one year, he moved to Germany.

In 1628 he started to work on several treaties, first among them <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_the_Direction_of_the_Mind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The rules for the Direction of the Mind on Wikipedia">The rules for the Direction of the Mind</a></cite>, which remained incomplete because he started writing <cite>The World</cite>.

## <cite>The World</cite>

Descartes decided not to publish <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_World_(book)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The World</a></cite> after the condemnation of Galileo by the Italian Inquisition in 1633, since it uses [Corpuscularianism](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Corpuscularianism) to explain **heliocentrism**.

In the treatise Descartes imagines a purely mechanical interpretation according to which God had created the world but by using an indefinite amount of matter which had only one characteristic: extension. Qualities, such as smell, are not material. Sensible properties result from the interaction of our mind with the world.

## <cite>Discourse on the Method</cite>

The <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Discourse_on_the_Method" title="Discourse on the Method on Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discourse on the Method</a></cite> is the preface of <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dioptrique" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dioptrics, Metereology and Geometry</a></cite>, and it was written in French so that anyone could understand it. He received a lot of criticisms for it.

## Other writings

In 1644 he published <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principles_of_Philosophy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Principles of Philosophy on Wikipedia">Principles of Philosophy</a></cite>, a handbook he wanted to become a textbook for universities and schools of Philosophy instead of Aristotelian writings. It wasn't exactly a guide, but a presentation of Descartes' personal research.

<cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Passions_of_the_Soul" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Passions of the Soul</a></cite>, written in Sweden, where there was Queen Cristine, an intellectual interested in new doctrines and sciences. Invited by her, and after a long time he decided to accept. After two months, because of the strong cold of the place, he got pneumonia and died.

## The tree of knowledge

> The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals

[The Tree of Knowledge](https://prezi.com/-ccvgh4vc9wu/descartes/)

Metaphysics has a fundamental role.\
The aim of Descartes (as of the other philosophers of the scientific revolution) is to criticize the form of previous Philosophy, specifically medieval and Aristotelian Philosophy, an din particular [Saint Tommaso D'Acquino](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/ "Thomas Aquinas on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"), who reinterpreted Aristotelian Philosophy from a Christian point of view.

## Parenthesis on Aristotelian Philosophy

From an ontological point of view, we consider Aristoteles' philosophy of being as *hylomorphism*

#### *Hylomorphism*

From the Greek *hylē*, “matter” and *morphē*, “form”: the idea that every being, living and non-living, is composed by two elements:
- substantial **form**: a spiritual element which gives to a being all the conceptual properties which make it what it is.
- primary **matter**: a material element, an indefinite amount of matter which is connected with its form.

[Definition of hylomorphism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hylomorphism "hylomorphism on Encyclopædia Britannica") on Encyclopædia Britannica

<br>

The correspondent theory of knowledge is empiricism:

when we know something, we first experience it with our senses and then we generalize it through our imagination, and we grasp the essence of that being, concluding what that being is.

The first step of knowledge is the interaction with the object, then we know it by diving deeper into the essence of that being.
