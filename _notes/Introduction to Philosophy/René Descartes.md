Understanding the new currents of thought, graduated in **law** at the university of Poitier, he then enrolled in the army of Nassau, a protestant prince. He spent a lot of time in Holland. He started the thirty years war in the protestant army, then, after one year, he moved to Germany.

in 1628 he started to work on several treaties, first among them <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_the_Direction_of_the_Mind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The rules for the Direction of the Mind</a></cite>, which remained incomplete because he started writing his 30 years long work <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_World_(book)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The World</a></cite> deciding not to publish it because +++

### The World

I imagine that God had created the world non in 6 days, but by using an indefinite amount of matter which had only one characteristic: extension (width, height, +++). Qualities, : smell, are not material. Sensible properties result from the interaction of our mind with the world.

Preface of <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dioptrique" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dioptrics, Metereology and Geometry</a></cite>, written in French so that anyone could understand it.

He received a lot of criticisms for it.

three years later, <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Meditations on First Philosophy</a></cite>, a handbook he wrote as a textbooks for university and schools of philosophy. Not exactly a guide, but a presentation of Descartes' personal research.

Invited by her, and after a long time he decided to accept. After two months, because of the strong cold of the place, he got pneumia and died.

### The tree of knowledge

> The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals

[The Tree of Knowledge](https://prezi.com/-ccvgh4vc9wu/descartes/)

Metaphysics has a fundamental role.

The aim of Descartes (and other philosophers of the scientific revolution) is to criticize especially on form of previous philosophy: medieval and Aristotelic philosophy, especially [Saint Tommaso D'Acquino](+++), who interpreted Aristotelic Philosophy from a Christian point of view.

#### Parenthesis on Aristotelic Philosophy

From an ontological point of view, the Aristotelic philosophy of being, we consider Aristoteles' philosophy as

##### *Hylomorphism*

From Greek *hylē*, “matter”; *morphē*, “form”; the idea that every being, living and non-living, is composed by two elements:

- substantial **form**: a spiritual element which gives to a being all the conceptual properties which make it what it is.
- primary **matter**: a material element, an indefinite amount of matter which is connected with its form.

[Definition of hylomorphism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hylomorphism) on Encyclopædia Britannica

The correspondent theory of knowledge is 

#### Empiricism

When we know something, we first experience it with our senses and then we generalize it through our imagination, and we grasp the essence of that being, concluding what that being is.

The first step of knowledge is the interaction with the object, then we know it by diving deeper into the essence of that being.

<br>

### *Meditations on First Philosophy*

### The “Trunk”

The only element which exist by itself is extension, everything else is given by the relation between us and the object. Example of cold hands in cold water and warm hands in cold water. Thus, subjective states.

The metaphysics objects of the Meditations

Why the existence

<p class="date">23<sup>rd</sup> September 2020</p>

The two main metaphysical points of the meditations
- Descartes dualism has an aim towards physics: if we can prove that the human mind can exist independently from the body, we can then conclude that the body is pure extension. Then the world (Physics) can be explained by **motion** and **matter** only.

The existence of God is needed to prove that Empiricism doesn't world: knowledge comes independently from the experience of the world, since God “implanted” some thoughts into our mind.

### Style

- The use of **first person** is essential, starting from the first point, since it argues about the existence of the self.

(Pierre Bayle, one of the first journalists) 

- +++
- Show and lead the way from error to truth. “Meditations” was used for religious writing, and it was chosen by Descartes to show an evolution, a progression, and a change. A change which can revolutionize our lives.

About using God to discard empiricism: Pascal criticizes the use of God to prove Descartes' point since in this way God is merely conceived as the starter of everything, but useless for everything else

<br>

## Truth

Identity between our ideas and reality. God, which doesn't want to deceive us, guarantees that if we are sure, we have no doubt about something, it means it's true. Clearness and distinctness mean truth

## First Meditation

Skepticism as a mean to reach knowledge. What is indoubtable is true, what is doubtable (not completely undoubtable) is false.

Not an answer to every possible question, but proving the minimum elements to explain Physics.

#### Arguments for doubting

> It is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived on us even once

Not trusting senses

- Mad people +++
- The dream +++

(According to Descartes, children are Aristothelian)

Only one narrating person, but, actually, two distinct “Descarteses”: the child Descartes, and the adult, current, Descartes

It's impossible for us to doubt about mathematics, but is it possible to imagine something which could discard even Math? The answer is God.

the evil demon is a summary of all the previous arguments

<br>

### God

We have to prove the existence of God to later prove his not being daceitful. God guarantees that subjective certainty is an objective certainty, “a bridge”.

<br>

## Innatism

- The idea of the mind
- The idea of God
- Idea of the bodies -> extension -> mathematics

It is then not some kind of abstraction but the real essence of the world
