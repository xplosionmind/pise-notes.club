*Of the Association of Ideas*

<p class="date">28<sup>th</sup> September 2020</p>

What are the different kinds of notions we can have in our minds?

> To me, there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, *Resemblance*, *Continguity* in time or place, and *Cause* or *Effect*.

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>Enquiry</cite>, III, §2</p>

If we look closely, even though imagination may seem unbounded, it is limited to knowledge which come from experience.

We will never be sure that relations of ideas are actually limited to these three classes, but all we can do

> is to run over several instances, and examine carefully the principle \[…\]. The more instances we examine, and the more care we employ, the more assurance shall we acquire, that the enumeration, which we form from the whole, is compleat and entire.

(close to [[Bertrand Russel|Russel]]'s interpretation)
