*Of the Origin of Ideas*

## Perceptions

***Perceptions*** are the essence of human relationship with the world.
- **Impressions**: direct and clear products of <q>immediate experience</q>
- **Ideas**: representations of previous impressions; <q>all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones</q>

No difference between impressions and ideas, only a question of force (*Enquiry*, II, §3).

There are no rules to know (unlike in Descartes' [[First Meditation]]), knowledge simply comes from the direct experience of and in the world; Hume is not saying how we have to acquire knowledge. We can't have an idea without having had a previous corresponding impression.

Note: Hume uses “memory” as a synonym of “imagination”
