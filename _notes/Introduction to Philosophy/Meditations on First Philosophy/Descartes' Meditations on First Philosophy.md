The only element which exist by itself is extension, everything else is given by the relation between us and the object. Example of cold hands in cold water and warm hands in cold water. Thus, subjective states.








-   first philosophy is the same metaphysics that Aristotle used
-   first philosophy because according to Descartes, it is about the epistemology world (for Aristotle is not). It teaches us how we can know what we know. 
-   Descartes wants to talk about what we need to have and what we need to know in order to build our tree of knowledge 
-   In particular, the two metaphysical objects that Descartes wants to analyze was “the existence of God” and “the real distinction between body and soul/mind” (two different substances). 

  

**Why God and the mind/body distinction are in the tree of knowledge?** 

Intro:
- What or who is the target? Christian men from Sorbonne University for Descartes. He did not wanted to do Galilei’s end and kept his ideas for himself.
- He followed Aristotle’s philosophy because it was accepted by the Church. According to A. the matter that composes our bodies is different from the celestial matter because our matter will perish eventually. There are 4 elements (water, earth, water, fire). He also thought that each body has a different substantial form so they can form a different thing, animal or human being (with their unique properties that are defined together with their type of motions and mind).
-   Descartes thought that Aristotle’s confusion between mind and body derived from the 
-   Only the quantitative properties define the bodies, this means that nothing else pertains to the body and all bodies are made of matter (and there is only one single type of matter, quantitative matter) 
-   Physics —> only works if mind and body are meant to be together (mechanical physics)

  

Why the existence of God is so important for the origin of knowledge?

To Mersenne (Friar in Paris who had connection with scientists) \*period of scientific revolution\*

-   4) What he thinks about the relationship between God and truth. It is important, because he stated that **God creates the Truth exactly as he creates everything**. 
-   Mersenne asked what he thought about the relations between God and Truth. We can understand world because our mind works exactly the same as God’s (the only difference is quantitative not qualitative, about knowledge). Human beings than can have a real knowledge of the world.
-   Only if we state that eternal truth (mathematical truth, logical truth) are created than we can say we can fully understand them. They are innate. 
-   Why doesn’t God change this truth? How can we be sure that these truths are the same for human beings? They are created than we can totally understand them. The meditations will answer to this too. Meditations show that our knowledge, innate ideas correspond exactly to reality and to understand it we have to look inside ourselves onto our ideas. 
-   Descartes’ meditations, want to show us the way to reach the truth after a life of errors. It is written in 1p.s. Anybody can arrive to the same truth, we only have to go on the same path. Only God guarantees that he is not a deceiver himself (not connected to goodness). God cannot change his own essence, so he cannot change the truth (Thomas Aquinas).
-   Descartes wanted to be Radical, this is a challenge that we have to accept/refuse. Everyone that reads this book can suggest their opinion, but he wanted to destroy all the doubts. Only if we start over from the base then we can go build something strong
-   The first truth that we can attain = the existence of the ego. Cogito Ergo Sum.
-   1) What can be called into doubt
-   2)
-   3) Problem of the Error. Why do we go wrong if God it is not a deceiver
-   4)
-   5) Nature of the matter ( 3 demonstration of the existence of God)
-   6) Existence of the body. Mental experiment.

The metaphysics objects of the Meditations

Why the existence

<p class="date">23<sup>rd</sup> September 2020</p>

The two main metaphysical points of the meditations
- Descartes dualism has an aim towards physics: if we can prove that the human mind can exist independently from the body, we can then conclude that the body is pure extension. Then the world (Physics) can be explained by **motion** and **matter** only.

The existence of God is needed to prove that Empiricism doesn't world: knowledge comes independently from the experience of the world, since God “implanted” some thoughts into our mind.

### Style

- The use of **first person** is essential, starting from the first point, since it argues about the existence of the self.

(Pierre Bayle, one of the first journalists) 

- +++
- Show and lead the way from error to truth. “Meditations” was used for religious writing, and it was chosen by Descartes to show an evolution, a progression, and a change. A change which can revolutionize our lives.

About using God to discard empiricism: Pascal criticizes the use of God to prove Descartes' point since in this way God is merely conceived as the starter of everything, but useless for everything else

<br>

## Truth

Identity between our ideas and reality. God, which doesn't want to deceive us, guarantees that if we are sure, we have no doubt about something, it means it's true. Clearness and distinctness mean truth

## First Meditation

Skepticism as a mean to reach knowledge. What is indoubtable is true, what is doubtable (not completely undoubtable) is false.

Not an answer to every possible question, but proving the minimum elements to explain Physics.

#### Arguments for doubting

> It is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived on us even once

Not trusting senses

- Mad people +++
- The dream +++

(According to Descartes, children are Aristotelian)

Only one narrating person, but, actually, two distinct “Descarteses”: the child Descartes, and the adult, current, Descartes

It's impossible for us to doubt about mathematics, but is it possible to imagine something which could discard even Math? The answer is God.

the evil demon is a summary of all the previous arguments

<br>

### God

We have to prove the existence of God to later prove his not being deceitful. God guarantees that subjective certainty is an objective certainty, “a bridge”.

<br>

## Innatism

- The idea of the mind
- The idea of God
- Idea of the bodies -> extension -> mathematics

It is then not some kind of abstraction but the real essence of the world
