# C.S. Peirce

He believed that there was something worth investigating in terms of logic analysis in the matter of the discovery of hypotheses.

## The logic of Abduction

a different type of logic we needed to adopt: abductive, an <q>ampliative</q> type of inference

inferences: 
| explicative | ampliative |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| +++         | +++        |

> +++ FROM SLIDES

Reasoning abductively

> +++

1. Surprising fact
2. obser


An inference not to the final truth of the hyp, but to the plausibility for my hyp to be true.

The best way to do this, if of course sending the hyp of to trial.

Three absolutely separate types of inference.

### Types of inference

all part of the same process of inquiry
- abduction
- deduction
- induction

how does P. accounts to the idea of actually coming up with the hyp?

### Making a hypothetical assertion

1. the hyp must explain the facts
2. "" must add knowledge to the facts
3. "" creates resemblance between different types of facts
