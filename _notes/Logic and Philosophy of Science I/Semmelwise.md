He worked in the first maternal division. Observations on a mysterious disease, the *puerperal fever*.

Description of the problem +++

Hempel was quite fascinated about S. observations, considering it the perfect example of the H-D reasoning.

The problem is not approached by reasoning inductively.

He outlined several different hypotheses, testing them with evidence or changes.

This until he stumbled upon an event which seemed to be a more promising one: a colleague was ferito+++ by an assistant with the same scalpel used to perform an autopsy; he contracted symptoms similar to the ones in the mothers, and eventually died.

He then supposes that the transmission of the infection were caused by doctors not cleaning their hands after coming out of the morgue.

The doctors were suggested to wash their hands, and the mortality decreased.

Before, modus tollens, then, a high risk of falling into a fallacy: therefore, he tests his predictions by means of other hypotheses. this was not very well received by the medical community.

The difference from Popper pseudo-science lies in confutating and testing the evidence in support of an hyp, not dogmatically building other rules to support the most promising one.

where to use induction:

> +++ HEMPEL FROM SLIDES

Predictions are used to test the hypotheses

## Logical problems of H-D in this context

- H: if doctors wash their hands with chlorine morality falls 
- A: further premise: chlorine destroys infectious matter, unlike soap

If H **and** A, then p

if not p, we can't understand if the falsity lies in A or H

### Second problem

S. starting point was to be discovered, supposed, not given.

- How do we find an hypotheses able to account for the situation?
- How do we find a **good** hypotheses?

What type of explanation are we providing?

not why `x`, but why `x` instead of `y`

Comparison among hypotheses.

S. is not simply +++, but he embarks in a very research program, trying to understand what works and what not. It's not a mere “happy guess”, but S. acts in a very *preparatory ground*.
