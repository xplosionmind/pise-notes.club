[Paul Feyerabend](https://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy") on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Formerly a Popper's student, and later on he became one of the most provocative critics of Popper.

Notes about him: adventurous life, academically inconsistent, moving a lot eh eventually became famous.

## <cite>Against Method</cite>

Methodological anarchism

Starting from sharing Popper's view, then bit by bit to a no-rule epistemology: there's no such thing as a unique method able to describe science

<q>anything goes</q>


the book is a long personal letter to Lakatos. It looks like a dialog with provocative passages.

An anti-lakatoshian interpretation: history is unpredictable, complex and unknown. To take part to any discussion and take on anything to help on along the way.

The example of Galileo

Violating the rules of your own time and show the rules you're proposing are actually better. This violation doesn't happen according to Kuhn's rules.

Inventing a new idea of experience and then we argue starting from this.

+++ ex. of the platonic theory of anamnesys

another example of the use of the telescope by Galileo:

he uses the telescope. In this sense, f. says this is a masterpiece of propaganda. The opportunist is someone.

What does violating the rules mean:
- not accidental
- necessary to progress.
- to go completely in a new direction

From "everything is under control" of Popper to a post-Popperian time which gets very far from its starting point.

There's no "good method" to be applied to everything no matter what, you have to choose a method specifically suited for the given context
