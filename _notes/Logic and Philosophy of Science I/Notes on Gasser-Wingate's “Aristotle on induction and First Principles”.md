From [[Gasser-Wingate - Aristotle on induction and first principles.pdf]]:

Induction (ἐπαγωγή):
> a form of cognitive development that begins with perception and progresses through a series of increasingly sophisticated states in which various universal concepts come to be formed in our souls

<p class="cite">page 2</p>

Doubts:

1. First principles are propositions, while in Aristotle knowledge of these ultimately takes the universal form of concepts
2. It's not sufficient to know and understand these fundamental propositions, they are to be studied *as* <q>the necessary explanatorily primitive truths from which all of our scientific understanding is derived</q>.

Explanations:

2. two possible explanations:
	- *Νοῦς* as both the **state** of the mind and the **faculty** of reaching first principles
	- Aristotle is offering <q>a highly elliptical explanation of our acquisition of first principles</q>, and his explanation lacks important steps to be accomplished after the inductive process

`footnote 10`: The necessity of recognizing attributes a subject has as *necessary* qualities to make it such, as seen later on in [[Natural kinds]].

Requiring to prove first principles would make scientific understanding impossible: an <q>explanatory regress</q> would take place; we must possess scientific understanding and get to it in an alternative, non-demonstrative, way.
