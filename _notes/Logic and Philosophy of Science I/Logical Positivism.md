## The Vienna Circle

The [Vienna Circle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/ "Vienna Circle on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"), from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

> The Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers and philosophically interested scientists who met under the (nominal) leadership of Moritz Schlick for often weekly discussions of problems in the philosophy of science during academic terms in the years from 1924 to 1936.

> \[…\] its members styled themselves as conceptual revolutionaries who cleared the stables of academic philosophy by showing metaphysics not simply to be false, but to be cognitively empty and meaningless. In addition, they often associated their attempt to overcome metaphysics with their public engagement for scientific Enlightenment reason in the ever-darkening political situation of 1920s and 1930s central Europe. Small wonder then that the Vienna Circle has sharply divided opinion from the start.

## Core values

Logical positivism, or logical empiricism, had at its core a few fundamental values and attitudes:
- a critical attitude towards traditional Philosophy
- Philosphy should deal with the only type of authentic and reliable knowledge, namely **science**
- the purpose of philosophy is to provide a neat and clear scientific method, by rigorously applying **logical language**
- <u><strong>experience</u> is the only source for knowledge</u>, while philosophy alone can't provide anything. The only way to make science evolve is by taking advantage of experience.

## The unity of science

Logic is the method, while experience is the content, the material of study. The aim is to make the same logical method to be applied to all sciences, unified under the same method.

### Goals

- a **descriptive task**: providing a universal language for **any** science
- a **normative goal**: prescribing how a science should formulate its theories, in order to classify them as "scientific"

## Logical approach

Traditional Aristotelian logic isn't adequate for Logical Positivism's purpose.

The only type of logic which is precise enough is **modern symbolic knowledge**.

## Philosophical approach

Philosophy is just a tool to address issues which come from science.

Therefore, in a situation where empirical material lacks, the Logical Positivist approach can't be used.

## Acceptable statements

Since there are rigorous rules to apply logic reasoning, the only acceptable statements are
- synthetic statements a posteriori
- analytic statements a priori

### Links to Hume

We can notice here a resemblance to Hume's philosophy:   
there's a strong distinction between relations of ideas and matters of facts.

### Meaningfulness

Any assertion not belonging to logic or to states of affairs in some way empirically verifiable are not meaningful, nonsense.

## The Principle of Verification

A lot of emphasis on the system of verification: how to verify if a statement is actually meaningful.

This principle was one of the most discussed and criticized, re-elaborated several times and rejected by many. (Among the ones which refuted it, [[Karl Popper]])

Verification is both:
- a criterion of meaning
- a test to understand whether a statement is meaningful; a sort of *true-or-false* exam on the content under examination

### Alfred Jules Ayer

[A.J. Ayer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/ "Alfred Jules Ayer on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy") (1910–1989)'s main writing is <cite><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Language,_Truth,_and_Logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Language, Truth and Logic</a></cite>

He became the British representative of Logical Positivism, by bringing this philosophy to his country for the first time in history.

Very influenced by Russel since early age, in particular interested in his skepticism: this argument followed him during all of his career

Also influenced by G. Ryle, who introduced him to the founder of the Vienna Circle, of which he then became the only British member.

#### The principle of Verifiability

> We say that a sentence is factually significant \[meaningful\] ... if, and only if, \[we know\] how to verify the proposition which it purports to express – that is, (...) what observations would lead \[us\], under certain conditions, to accept the proposition as being true, or reject it as being false.”

First of all, sentences have to be verifiable.

Example:

> there are mountains on the farther side of the Moon

This sentence at Ayer's time wasn't practically or actually verifiable, yet it was conceivable as a logical possibility.

For a statement to be verifiable it's sufficient for it to be potentially verifiable.

Truth logically comes before verification, which subsequently occurs empirically.

> Plainly we all understand, in many cases believe, propositions which we have not in fact taken steps to verify. Many of these are propositions which we could verify if we took enough trouble. \[…\] A simple and familiar example of such a proposition is the proposition that there are mountains on the farther side of the moon. No rocket has yet been invented which would enable me to go and look at the farther side of the moon, so that I am unable to decide the matter by actual observation. But I do know what observations would decide it for me, if, as is theoretically conceivable, I were once in a position to make them. And therefore I say that the proposition is verifiable in principle, if not in practice, and is accordingly significant.

An example of an unverifiable statement:

> God works in mysterious ways

Are there any observations which can prove this?

> the meaning of a proposition is the method
of its verification

<p class="cite">Schlick, <cite>Meaning and Verification</cite></p>

> \[…\] if we accept conclusive verifiability as our criterion of significance, as some positivists have proposed, our argument will prove too much. Consider, for example, the case of general propositions of law – such propositions, namely, as “arsenic is poisonous"; “all men are mortal"; “a body tends to expand when it is heated." It is of the very nature of these propositions that their truth cannot be established with certainty by any finite series of observations."

Universal vs. Historical propositions, there are ***strong*** and ***weak*** statements

> A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established in experience. But it is verifiable, in the weak sense, if it is possible for experience to render it probable.

Statements may only be highly probable: the stronger type of verification is actually too strong. A weaker link is enough to assert verifiability.

> Accordingly, we fall back on the weaker sense of verification. We say that the question that must be asked about any putative statement of fact is not, Would any observation make its truth or falsehood logically certain? But simply, Would any observations be <u>relevant to</u> the determination of its truth or falsehood? And it is only if a negative answer is given to this second question that we conclude that the statement under consideration is nonsensical.

Relevance is a tricky notion: it's not used with a specific logical meaning, it relies on interpretation. Nevertheless, a univocal meaning.

> 'weak' verification \[…\] cannot be prevented from opening the gates for any statement, however meaningless, to enter, provided that someone can be found to claim that observation is in some sense relevant to it. As a criterion for distinguishing sense from nonsense relevance plainly does not work: indeed to accept it is in effect to abrogate the principle of verification altogether.

<p class="cite">I. Berlin, <cite>Verifiability in Principle, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</cite>, XXXIX, 233.</p>

Ayer understands this counterargument, together with the many others he received.

Eventually, the theory itself becomes doubtable. There doesn't seem to be a test to verify this very method. The verifiability of a sentence becomes therefore exactly the type of metaphysical problem that Logical Positivists strongly avoided.

We can't axiomatically accept the verifiability principle since it can't even prove or explain its meaningfulness itself.
