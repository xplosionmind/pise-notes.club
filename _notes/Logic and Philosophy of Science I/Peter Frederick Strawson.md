A focus on the meaning of induction: the question of justification of the inductive method is wrongly posed itself. The belief in induction is not irrational.

To ask for a ‘justification’ of induction is to ask for a justification of induction in general, as a pattern of reasoning.   
What's at stake is whether induction as a whole is justifiable or justified.

It follows that to ask for a justification of induction in this sense is to ask for a proof that such logic process is actually viable.

The viability of induction can't come otherwise if not from deduction: thus, induction needs to be proved as a deductively valid logic process.

By satisfying this very demand, we're making induction a deductive-based process itself. Justifying induction with induction is absurd since its proof would be a never-ending cycle.

For Strawson, this conundrum can be found at the roots of any attempt to justify induction.

Could we give another sense to this demand? Can we try another solution?

> Sometimes it is expressed in the form of a request for proof that induction is a reasonable or rational procedure, that we have good grounds for placing reliance upon it.

## Unattainable proof

**statement**: Induction is rational only if it can be justified
**fact**: Induction cannot be justified

---

**conclusion**: induction is not rational

> It is an analytic proposition that it is reasonable to have a degree of belief in a statement which is proportional to the strength of the evidence in its favour; and it is an analytic proposition \[…\] that other things being equal the evidence for a generalization is strong in proportion as the number of favourable instances, and the variety of circumstances in which they have been found is great. So <u>to ask whether it is reasonable to place reliance on inductive procedures is like asking whether it is reasonable to proportion the degree of one’s convictions to the strength of the evidence</u>. Doing this is what ‘being reasonable’ means in such a context.
