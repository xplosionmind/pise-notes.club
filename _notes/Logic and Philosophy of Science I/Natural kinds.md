If all entities of type A share property `p`, (all pieces of gold have a specific atomic structure) are

Grouping things in kind is important in science, so that we can expect behaviors, inductive reasoning work accordingly; a great grounding for predictions

## Questions to settle

- what make us pick certain properties
- what make certain entities appear sufficiently similar (see [[Introduction to Scientific explanation#The raven Paradox]])

## Picking the right properties

Essences: properties which make an object belonging to that kind. Such kind is natural if it corresponds to recurrent properties which are in nature independently of human classifications

You need the meaning in order to refer to the kind

There's a planet where there's an element which looks like water, called by its inhabitants "water", but with different chemical properties. When inhabitants of both planets refer to “water” they mean different substances.

The example of the periodic table: this is the perfect example of natural kinds. Elements are neatly and precisely defined and distinguished, not by men but by nature.

## Microstructuralism

R. Hendry:

A kind is identified by the microstructural roperties of each element.

### Open issues

Even granting that water has a particular microstructure on what does it depend? Interactions might change, they're not always the same; even if we focus on similarities on a microstructural level, +++

This doesn't occur in chemistry only, also in biology.

The case of biological species again may be used to confute essentialism.

Two main ways of rethinking essentialism:
- proper cluster theory, Boyd
- promiscuous realism, J. Dupré   
in his perspective, essentialism is part of an epistemological packet, composed also by
	- determinism
	- reductionism

Disunity of sciences: reality as different levels of descriptions. Not an epistemological monism, but a plurality of methods, epistemic measures we use to depict our theories.

## Promiscuous realism

The metaphysics of modern science is taken to be deterministic in some way: +++.

The metaphor which represents it is the clock:   
a mechanism that, once represented, +++.

The above is useful in particular to understand the thesis of reactionism.

Complex mechanisms which becomes simpler and simpler.

Besides individual things, +++

Essentialism is in part defended by Dupré: there actually are basic divisions naturally in the world, but they aren't enough. The context of use chenges things, but this doesn't mean that there are no natural kinds.

The promiscuity of kinds +++

How this promiscuous position positions itself with regard to traditional metaphysics?

A natural kind must include anything which is fundamental to make that kind.

By means of n.k. we can classify entities. Grouping should not be accidental. Classification in a universal manner, not contingent.

Essences might be a way to classify natural terms.

How can we envisage a correspondence between artificial classification and actual qualities of entities.

These qualities themselves are the result of a theoretical speculation, not a self-evident characteristic.

Classifications are meant to have a purpose and a role.

Not an argument per se against realism, but the temptation is to say if we take what the world is to be a description of our words, +++

Anti-realism perspectives: our world is more what we label than what it actually is.

There is a difference also in social kinds, according to Hackings.

> +++S quarks are not aware

Natural kinds are defined as "indifferent": stationary, not passive, targets. They don't do any of the things that we do because they're not aware of the classifications we give them

about human kinds:

> +++S

Social kinds are “interactive”: their definition is strongly related to the label it's attributed to them. They rethink themselves accordingly.

There is a kind of feedback, looping effect, involved when we classify people.
