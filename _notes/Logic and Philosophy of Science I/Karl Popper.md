## The traditional formulation

The traditional formulation of the scientific method takes for granted what should be discussed instead, therefore it is defined as an **<q>uncritical</q> formulation**.

Popper offers a **<q>critical</q> reformulation**, which aims to get to the roots of traditional formulation and analyze what's taken for granted.

According to Popper, the traditional formulation has two main roots:

### The Common sense view

This view takes for granted that beliefs and regularities are justified by repeated observations.

There's nothing in our mind that doesn't come from experience, nevertheless we form expectations about things that are yet to happen.

It's taken for granted that observations, **if repeated**, are enough.

### Hume's problem

In Hume two problems which face each other, there's a conflict between the two:

#### The logical problem

Expectations have no logical justification. Induction doesn't bring to truth.

#### The psychological problem

We form expectations as a matter of habit.   
Hume is forced to embrace a kind of irrationalist epistemology: repetition isn't a valid argument. In this, Russel agrees:

> The lunatic who believes that he is a poached egg is to be condemned solely on the ground that he is a minority

<p class="cite">B. Russell, <cite>A History of Western Philosophy</cite></p>

## Popper's critical formulation

Hume is right: there are problems, nevertheless the psychological side of Hume's reasoning is not shared by Popper:   
we don't form expectations and beliefs from repetitions. We don't have to wait for regular repetition of occurrence or concurrence of events to give birth to expectations. Even Hume acknowledges this. Habits are't so because they're originated by repetition.

Popper believes Hume is struggling in grasping the psychological argument.

To prove he's right, Popper makes [[Popper - Conjectures and Refutations, chapter 1.pdf|the example of puppies sniffing a cigarette]].

Not only empirical evidence against repetition, but also a philosophical argument.

In Hume repetition is defined by similarity and resemblance of occurrences, but Hume doesn't realize that repetitions and occurrences are interpreted **by us**, we respond to situations **we** interpret to be similar.

The logic behind the point Popper is making:

> The kind of repetition envisaged by Hume can never be perfect; the cases he has in mind cannot be cases of perfect sameness; they can only be cases of similarity. <u>They are repetitions only from a certain point of view</u> \[…\]. But this means that, for logical reasons, there must always be a point of view – such as a system of expectations, anticipations, assumptions, or interests – before there can be any repetition; <u>which point of view, consequently, cannot be merely the result of repetition</u>

Repetitions occur only from the individual point of view. **Before** any repetition to happen, there's a point of view which supposes it.

We need to replace this “rather naive” idea with the idea that events we react to by interpreting them from the start, involving several particulars related to the individual.

There's a kind of infinite regress in Hume's psychological theory.

- we actively impose regularities upon the world
- we try to discover regularities and similarities
- without waiting for the premises, we jump to conclusions, which we will discard later if they get contradicted

We, as humans, always proceed by **trial and error**. 

??? These interpretations are then the same from individual to individual, so they regard man in general, or are they subjective?

Man has an inborn propensity to look for regularities

This is something similar to Bacon's interpretation, but the difference between Popper and Bacon lies in the **testing**.

### Relevance

This matter has a critical relevance if it's brought to light Popper's aim:

in science this attitude of imposible regularities is applied. Still, acting uncritically on this propensities would make us dogmatic creatures. We don't need to go against the propensity itself, but we need to get prepared to confront it when new discoveries or points of view or interpretations.

This is the form that within science this procedure of acting by trial and error is following.

What in everyday lives is trial and error, becomes in science a matter of **conjectures and refutations**.

## Popper's strategy

Can we reformulate the psychological problem so that we can understand where it's wrong and then rebuild all the methods all at once?

Popper wants to find a direction which takes a different path not only respectively to Hume's one, but to induction in general.

### The logical error behind repetition

Can an affirmative claim such as <q>X is true</q> be justified by empirical reason?

Obviously, we can't inductively conclude this according to Hume.

Popper's reformulation:

Can the claim <q>X is true or false</q>, or <q>it is true or false that Y</q> be justified by empirical reasons?

The answer here could be yes: sometimes we can conclude with logical certainty the falsehood of something.

The process Popper uses is not induction anymore, but deduction.

It follows a crucial question: can we make **a deductive use of experience**?

To understand Popper's argument, the concept of **material implication** needs to be understood.

## Material implication

All the meanings of the term *implication* can be conveyed to the statement “if, then”, thus all statements which take a conditional form.

Sentences are formed by the antecedent (if) and the consequent (then).

Material implication isn't a piece of reasoning: **it is the connection** between “if” and “then”. We can use it to describe syllogisms.

## *Modus ponens*

The use of material implication can be described as ***modus ponens*** (short for *modus ponendum ponens*, “the method of affirming by affirmation”), the mode of affirming the antecedent.

**NOTE**: This argument must not be confused with the method of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy.

#### Limits

An example of why *modus ponens* isn't suited for Popper's purposes:

- <q>If there is flash of light there is a clap of thunder</q>
- <q>There is a flash of light</q>

<q>Therefore, there is clap of thunder</q>

In this case, not necessarily every time there is a flash of light is because it's caused by a thunder.

## *Modus tollens*

*Modus ponens* is not the deductive procedure Popper has in mind, it's easy to fall in the problem of induction again.

*Modus tollens* is an opposite logical format which seems to be more suitable: short for *modus tollendum tollens*, it's the method of denying by denial.

It operates by <u>denying the consequent</u>.



**Note**: again, a fallacy would be to deny the antecedent.

### Why *modus tollens*

Since there are two main types of logical statements:
- **singular existential statements**, assertions about the existence of some particular thing. They are **Observational statements**, for example <q>There is an x that is a swan, and x is white</q>
- **universal statements**, assertions that categorize all
instances of something.

it's not possible to infer universal statements from observational statements, since inductively it may be possible, but it would be invalid.

Instead, by using *modus tollens*, we can with certainty falsify a universal statement starting by an observation which make it false.

If I can deny the consequent, I get a true statement. I conclude with certainty something just by applying ordinary deductive logic.

Can we **validly** (instead of invalidly) infer a universal statement from an observational statement?

## Falsification

- start with an hypothesis, a universal statement
- make a prediction about a certain singular happening.
- observation that contradicts the expected condition
- falsify the initial hypothesis

the above is the logic of falsification. With it, it's possible to draw conclusions with absolute certainty.

It's a matter of deductive logic: we're bound to falsify something when we're presented with a contradiction.

Experience is used as a test to prove that my previous universal statements are **false**.

An example: 
- <q>if all swans are white, then this swan must also be white</q>
- <q>this swan is black</q>
- <q>Therefore, not all swans are white</q>

In this way we can create an argument from experience:
- we have a deductive argument which uses experience to test the validity of a universal statement, only in a negative way.
- the singular observational statement is the **potential falsifier** for the universal statement it refers to

## Popper's solution

Infinitely many instances aren't enough to positively prove a universal statement for sure, while with falsification it's necessary only one to prove its falsity.

> The original problem of induction is the problem of justifying induction,(...) If you answer this problem by saying that what is called an ‘inductive inference’ is always invalid and therefore clearly not justifiable, the following new problem must arise: how do you justify your method of trial and error? Reply: the method of trial and error is a method of eliminating false theories by observation statements; and the justification for this is the <u>purely logical relationships of deducibility</u> which allows us to assert the falsity of universal statements if we accept the truth of singular ones.

## The problem of demarcation

What identifies science is the use of a method. Such method is empirical.

Induction has always played a rather central role, since it's a method based on experience. The existence of a method in science is often advocated to distinguish what is science and what's not.

Relying too much on scientific procedures may make scientists fall into dogmatism; make them desperate to confirm their theories, scientists lose their critical approach, so Popper is against this idea.

The difference between science and pseudo science for Popper lies in the need to find confirming evidence.

While pseudo-scientists are desperate to confirm their thesis, actual scientists provide risky and bold predictions which are very likely to be falsified.

Instead of using criticisms to confute their thesis, pseudo-scientists include them in their theories to avoid possible objections; they fight for the truthfulness of their statements.

Fundamentally, Popper highlights a difference in **attitude**.

For example, Einstein promoted, a completely different approach:
- he made a courageous prediction in advance of evidence…
- …hence he had a serious risk of being refuted

> If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted. The theory is incompatible with certain possible results of observation – in fact with results which everybody before Einstein would have expected. This is quite different from the situation I previously described, when it turned out that the theories in question were compatible with the most divergent human behaviour, so that it was practically impossible to describe any human behaviour that might not be claimed to be a verification of these theories.

Furthermore, truly scientific theories are **corroborated**, not proved, by evidence

>the degree of corroboration \[…\] is just a report about the state of discussion at time t.

We can't be sure something is true, but we certainly know for sure that at the given time the given theory is not false.

It's reasonable to accept a theory because **not yet refuted**. We may never know it, but we need to attach corroboration. Now it's corroborating, but if something comes up, I need to be ready to drop it.

If we actually succeed in falsifying a conjecture, it means the given theory has empirical content. What's wrong with pseudo-sciences is reinterpreting all potential falsifiers in such a way they become a support for their theories, but they never test anything.

The hallmark of genuine science is its **refutability**, **testability** or **falsifiability**.


### Recap

- Inductive method is a myth
- the actual procedure of science is theorizing, jumping to conclusions, and prove them later
- repetition has to be used only at the time of testing a conjecture
- falsification, not induction, has to be used as the right criterion of demarcation

In finding the right criterion of demarcation we find the correct way to make the argument from experience work.
