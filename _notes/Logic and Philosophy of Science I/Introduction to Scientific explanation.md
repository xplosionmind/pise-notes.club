How do scientific theories achieve the task of explaining science?\
The explanatory power of scientific theory relies on the laws it's built upon.

## From a practical point of view

An example: how is explainable that the displayed temperature of a thermometer inserted in a hot glass of water slightly decreases before rising.\
How can we describe the explanation that a scientist gives about the experiment?

Two types of statement:
- a statement which includes a series of contingent conditions
-a couple of more general statements:
	- the conductivity of glass
	- the coefficient of expansion of mercury

Together, these statements allow us to account for what we see.
