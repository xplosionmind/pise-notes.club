All laws of science lie to us:\
they could never be applied as-are in the real world: they describe highly ideal situations.

> Every theory we have proposed in Physics, even at the time when it was most firmly entrenched, was known to be deficient in specific and detailed ways.

<p class="cite">N. Cartwright, <cite>How The Laws of Physics Lie</cite></p>

The nature we deal with with laws is idealized. Phenomena interpreted are not strictly real.

Examples:\
<q>all bodies fall with the same speed, *ceteris paribus*</q>\
<q>provided the supply remains constant, the price of a product increases with growing demand, *ceteris paribus*</q>\
<q>haemoglobin binds O2, *ceteris paribus*</q>
