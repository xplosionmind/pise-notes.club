A focus on the <u>meaning of induction</u>: the question of justification of the inductive method is wrongly posed itself. The belief in induction is not irrational.

To ask for a ‘justification’ of induction is to ask for a justification of induction in general, as a pattern of reasoning.   
What's at stake is whether induction as a whole is justifiable or justified.

It follows that to ask for a justification of induction in this sense is to ask for a proof that such logic process is actually viable.

Therefore, induction as such would need to be justifiable in one of two ways:
- proving induction as a deductively valid process   
By satisfying this very demand, we would be making induction a deductive-based process itself.
- Justifying induction with induction, which is absurd since its proof would be a never-ending cycle.

According to Strawson, the solution to this conundrum may be found at the roots of any attempt to justify induction.

Could we give another sense to this demand?   
Can we try another solution?

> Sometimes it is expressed in the form of a request for proof that induction is a reasonable or rational procedure, that we have good grounds for placing reliance upon it.

## Unattainable proof

Rationality and justification of induction do not entail each other. Induction can be rational even if it's not justifiable.

<q>Induction cannot be justified</q>

So <u>to ask whether it is reasonable to place reliance on inductive procedures is like asking whether it is reasonable to proportion the degree of one’s convictions to the strength of the evidence</u>. Doing this is what ‘being reasonable’ *means* in such a context.

Rationality of induction is accepted analytically, since rationality is part of the meaning of induction itself. There's nothing else in the rationality of induction than having the

The demand for justification in induction happens because the two following statements are confused:
1. \[the universe is such that\] induction will continue to be successful
2. Induction is rational

--

1. *A posteriori*, contingent statement   
we have no guarantee that this holds and will hold forever; this is an inductive statement itself. 
2. *A priori*, analytic statement   
the rationality of induction is not about how the world is and how it works, but about the very meaning of the term, and what we attribute to it.

Even if the world turned to be totally chaotic, induction would still be rational, by telling us not to rely on regularities or to form expectations. Even if statement 1 falls apart, statement 2 will continue to hold, since the latter does not depend on the former. Thus, justifying induction doesn't condition its rationality.

Can we ultimately affirm that rationality is arbitrarily defined. Even if we do, we're not entitled to question this: calling something rational doesn't automatically make it rational.
