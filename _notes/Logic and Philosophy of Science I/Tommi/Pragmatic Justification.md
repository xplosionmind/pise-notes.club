By [Hans Reichenbach](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reichenbach/ "Hans Reichenbach on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"), from <cite>Experience and Prediction</cite> (1938):

> The inductivist is like a gambler

Man <u>makes a bet</u> by adopting inductive reasoning: he isn't nor asserting nor believing

### To <q>posit</q>

> we do no thereby say that we are convinced of its \[an event’s\] happening, that the proposition about its happening is true; we only decide to deal with it as a true proposition. The word ‘posit’ may express this taking for true \[…\] ; the reason why we decide to take the proposition as true is that this decision leads us, in repeated applications, to the greatest ratio of success.

<p class="cite">Reichenbach, <cite>Experience and Prediction</cite>, 1938; p.313</p>

Induction is the best bet: the scientist is also in a worse position vis-a-vis the gambler; the latter at least knows his odds, the scientist bases on a bet all of his knowledge.

We don't leave everything to chance, we opt for induction trying to secure ourselves with the best available way:

> The inductive inference is a procedure which is to furnish us with the best assumption about the future. If we do not know the truth about the future, there maybe nonetheless be a best assumption about it, i.e. <u>a best assumption relative to what we know</u>.

<p class="cite">Reichenbach, <cite>Experience and Prediction</cite>, 1938; p.348-9</p>

We aren't solving Hume's problem of induction, but we are pragmatically closing it.

> if we sit at the wheel of a car and want to turn the car to the right, why do we turn the wheel to the right?

> A blind man who has lost his way in the mountains feels a trail with its stick. He does not know where the path will lead him, or whether it may take him so close to the edge of a precipice that he be plunged into the abyss. Yet he follows the path, groping his way step by step; for if there is any possibility of getting out of the wilderness, it is by feeling his way along the path. As blind men we face the future; but we feel a path. And we know, if we can find a way through the future it is by feeling our way along this path.

<p class="cite">Reichenbach, <cite>Experience and Prediction</cite>, 1938; p.482</p>

Is this a satisfactory solution? If yes, how is the success of science explainable up to now?

How to relate our feeling to experience. A high degree of verifiability, of certainty, but not absolute truthfulness.
