All the meanings of the term *implication* can be conveyed to the statement “if, then”.\
Implication is a relation that holds for statements that take a conditional form.\

In Symbolic logic:
$$
p \rightarrow q
$$

- Logical implication
- Definitional implication
- Causal implication
- Decisional implication

Material implication isn't a piece of reasoning: **it is the connection** between “if” and “then” (classic Fregean logic). We can use material implication to describe syllogisms: it connects the antecedent to the consequent.
