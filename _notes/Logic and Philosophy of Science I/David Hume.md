> all the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds \[…\], *Relations of Ideas*, and *Matters of Fact*

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. IV, Part I, 20</p>

<br>

## Relations of ideas

> every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite></p>

Mathematical or theoretical operations: they are characterized by the fact that they are <q>discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe</q>.

Relations of ideas can be demonstrated to be false, they can be  


<br>

## Matters of fact

> *That the sun will not rise to-morrow* is no less intelligible a proposition and implies no more contradiction, than the affirmation, *that it will rise*

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. IV, Part I, 26</p>

Matters of fact imply existence; the above is valid only in the case the Sun exists. There is <u>no logical connection</u> between these two sentences.

Matters of fact are impossible to be logically placed in a context since:
- there is no logic contradiction in two alternate occurrences;
- a proposition about an entity automatically implies the existence of such entity, and it has no meaning whatsoever without that entity.

Existence isn't a matter of logic reasoning; any *a priori* knowledge of matters of fact is impossible. What is

> the nature of that evidence which assumes us of any real existence and matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the records of our memory.

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. IV, Part I, 23</p>

Use induction to conceive as infallible his statement

Only some of our factual knowledge is based on what we perceive or what we remember.

Most of our factual knowledge concerns things or events which actually are quite remote from us.

All our reasoning regarding matters of fact relies on a connection between a present fact and some other fact from which the other is inferred from.

How do we reason?

We reason in the same way of when we think in the context of **cause and effect**. Can we apply actual knowledge on this connections?   
We actually do this, but **how** do we do it, and why?

<p class="date">12<sup>th</sup> November 2020</p>


## Model

Hume's model of reasoning is the **cause and effect**, a connection between between a present fact and another one, in order to infer one from the other. Connecting an effect to a cause.

`???` We start from the effect or from the cause?   
A: from the effect

How are we able to make such an inference?

Of course starting *entirely* from **experience**: it will also make us state that under certain conditions we can always project events in the future. Experience can make us expect the connection even before events to actually happen.

Experience of repeated connection creates some sort of expectation in us, which consolidates in a habit, a <q><strong>custom</strong></q>. We take cause and effects for granted, and it's partly deceiving: we pretend we're making an inference, which is a logical process, while we're experiencing a psychological attitude, expectation.

### Counterarguments

Hume comes up with counterarguments to prove his thesis.

How the mind would proceed if we analyzed an event <u>without consulting past observations</u>:

1. The mind has to invent or imagine some event as an effect, arbitrarily
2. Tie between cause and and effect is then arbitrary, too

We need to think these observations as events, not as objects. When a rock breaks a window, it's not about the rock, but about a rock hitting a window and therefore hitting it.

#### Hume's example

Imagine a billiard table. Nothing gives us the slightest hint that when a ball hits another ball the other one will go in a certain direction: **anything** can happen if we don't consider what we experienced previously. By reasoning only, we'll never be able to choose an outcome rather than another.

**Contiguity**, **priority**, **regularity**

> Here is a billiard ball lying on the table, and another ball moving towards it with rapidity. They strike; and the ball which was formerly at rest now acquires a motion. It is evident that the two balls touched one another before the motion was communicated, and that there was no interval betwixt the shock and the motion. Contiguity in time and place is therefore a requisite circumstance to the operation of all causes. It is evident, likewise, that the motion which was the cause is prior to the motion which was the effect. Priority in time is therefore another requisite circumstance in every cause.

Using **our mind alone** we can't affirm what is going to happen *unless* we have previous knowledge

Thus, there's an arbitrary tie between cause and effect, and only experience can help us, in this way.

---

> when we reason apriori, and consider merely any object or cause, as it appears to the mind, independent of observation, it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object, such as its effect; much less, show us the inseparable and inviolable connexion between them. A man must be very sagacious who could discover by reasoning that crystal is the effect of heat, and ice of cold, without being previously acquainted with the operation of these qualities.

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. VII, Part II, 27</p>

## Deductive vs Inductive reasoning

Statement 1:
(p &vee; q) &and; !q &rarr; p

Statement 2:   
<q>there is a flash of light</q> (event A)
\-\-\-
<q>There will be a clap of thunder</q> (event B)

As it's evident, statement 1 is logical, where the second one is not.   
So, we may reformulate S2 in such a way it may be logically interpreted:

<q>There is a flash of light</q> &and; <q>if there is a flash of light, there will be a clap of thunder</q>
\-\-\-
<q>There will be a clap of thunder</q>

Let's try to create a contradiction by denying the conclusions.

How can we logically infer that just because past A-events have been followed by B-events, future A-events will be followed by B-events?

### Adding a premise to statement II
 
### The problem of induction

from 11:48

The connection from an event to a conclusion isn't direct nor immediate. A **medium** (an additional premise) it's needed and Hume is quite skeptical about this medium and Hume points out several times that such a medium can't be rationally justified.

The premise (+++ FROM SLIDES) has to be that the future is 

### The Principle of Induction

Or ***Principle of the uniformity of nature***

+++ FROM SLIDES

This, according to Hume, can't be safely accepted.

By using the premise we'll introduce a “vicious circularity” because we're taking for granted the exact type of reasoning the validity of which we're trying to understand.

> +++ FROM SLIDES

So it becomes a question-begging argument

??? isn't it the same thing as the demonstration of Aristothelean first principles?

### Deductive vs Inductive circularity

#### Deductive circularity

The simplest version of this is an argument which uses its conclusion as its premise.

+++

#### Inductive circularity

`c` is the missing link, and we need to make it explicit, yet it's itself an inductive inference: it says exactly the same thing.

Circularity is vicious here because we're <q cite="">using induction to justify induction</q>**.

<br>
<br>

Why do we keep using inductive reasoning?

To Hume, there's no logical reason; the psychological explanation is the only reasonable one we can give.

The appeal to custom:

> +++ FROM SLIDES

> +++ FROM SLIDES

“Natural instinct”

If we can't set goals, expectations for our future, what would give us some sort of confidence about the purpose of the future?

> +++ FROM SLIDES

### Conclusion

- Inductive reasoning can't be logically justified
- Inductive reasoning is instinctual, thus inevitable
- Inductive reasoning is at the basis of our beliefs about the future
- Inductive reasoning informs both scientific inquiry and purposive action
- Inductive reasoning indispensable +++

## Questions

### 1

+++ FROM SLIDES

We'd start questioning several beliefs based on inductions:
- memories
- the durability of objects
- etc +++

### 2


+++ link with Russel

<br>
<br>

## Bertrand Russel

Via induction we can account for the **probability** of the conclusion, never certainty.

> +++ FROM SLIDES

Belief in the uniformity of nature -> probable reason

An asymptotic approach to certainty through probability.

<br>
<br>

It's habitual to form expectations in this inductive way, but can this habit be justified rationally? Is it reasonable anyway?

<br>
<br>

## Pragmatic Justification

By [Hans Reichenbach](+++)

Man makes a bet by adopting inductive reasoning: surely not asserting, but not even believing.

### “To posit”

> +++ FROM SLIDES

Induction is the best bet 

> The path +++ FROM SLIDES

“**feel**”

Is this a satisfactory solution? If yes, how is the success of science explainable up to now?
