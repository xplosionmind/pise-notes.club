## Hume's problem of induction

<p class="date">6<sup>th</sup> November 2020</p>

> all the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds (â€¦), *Relations of Ideas*, and *Matters of Fact*

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. IV, Part I, 20</p>

<br>

## Relations of ideas

> every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite></p>

Mathematical or theoretical operations: they are characterized by the fact that they are <q>discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe</q>.

<br>

## Matter of fact

<q>the Sun will rise tomorrow</q> is as intelligible as <q>the Sun will not rise tomorrow</q>

Matters of fact imply existence; the above is valid only in the case the Sun exists. There is <u>no logical connection</u> between these two sentences.

Existence isn't therefore a matter of logic reasoning.

Any *a priori* knowledge of matters of fact is impossible. What is

> the nature of that evidence which assumes us of any real existence and matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the records of our memory.

<p class="cite">Hume, <cite>An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</cite>, Sect. IV, Part I, 23</p>

Use induction to conceive as infallible his statement

Most of our factual knowledge concerns things or events which actually are quite remote from us.
