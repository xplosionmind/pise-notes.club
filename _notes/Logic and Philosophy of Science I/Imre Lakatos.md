Retaining falsification while reducing its strong impact.

Falsification in this case isn't immediately applied.

#### Sophisticated falsificationism

Lakatos proposed +++

How to make Popperian falsification better?
1. in science rarely if not never we deal with one single theory only. We deal with sequences of theories. The method is a sequence of theories called a ***research programme***: a set of theories which all agree on something, called ***the hard core***. Central thesis of the program which are irrefutable. To belong to this research programme you need to agree to its hard core. Often the hard core may even be of a metaphysical type
2. The hard core isn't enough to define a scientific programme: these claims don't tell you what to observe at night in the sky. We set a set of auxiliary hypotheses.

How can we therefore be sure of what we're actually falsifying? The best you can claim is that you falsify the h.c+ aux.hyp. and you don't know wether you falsified the former or the latter. Where to position the falsification?

Lakatos introduces negative and positive heuristics

negative h:

work with the aux. hyp. only. Defend the righteousness of the hard core. We build then new theories with the same hard core but with different Theories based on the same hard core. We expose only the auxiliary hypotheses to falsificaiton.

How do we make these auxiliary +++

positive h:

+++

Can we still use sophis fals as a criterion for demarcation?

Lakatos: sometimes it is rational to persist with the hard core even with most of the aux. hyp. are discarded. Since research actually does this, it's acceptable to do it.

How do we distinguish really scientific r.p.mmes from the bad ones?

there are ways, says L., because we have ways to distinguish if a research programme with regard to a specific one

progressive programs:
- more empirical content
- new facts or predictions

degenerating programme:
- no novel prediction
- novel predictions are false

Lakatos looks at history: both progressive and deg look at history +++


wrapping up:

departures from Popper:
- Lakatos has a more liberal interpretation of demarcation. A more forgiving criterion
- being scientific is a matter of `more` or `less`, in Popper instead is a matter of `yes` or `no`   
it's the historical appreciation of a method
