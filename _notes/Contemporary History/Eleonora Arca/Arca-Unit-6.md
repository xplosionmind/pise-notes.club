[Industrial Revolution in Europe 1750-1914 ]{.c11}

[]{.c1}

### [1. The Characteristics of the Industrial Revolution]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9 .c10}

[the main factors of british industrialization:]{.c1}

-   [ colonialism (the colonies provided raw materials), mercantile
    capitalism and]{.c1}

[overseas trade]{.c1}

-   [corporate enterprise and stock exchange]{.c1}
-   [agricultural improvement, enclosures, land circulation]{.c1}
-   [political system, mercantilism:]{.c1}

[the liberal climate present in Great Britain at that time, which
supported investment and market-oriented economic sectors, granting
political participation for the nobility and the upper class]{.c1}

-   [mentality of the nobility: ]{.c1}

[they became increasingly enterprise-oriented and adopted a capitalistic
mentality]{.c1}

-   [monetary stability and banking system: ]{.c1}

[they spread from the city to the countryside agriculture became
market-oriented and the agriculture served external markets. this
distinguished Britain from continental Europe, where the nobility didn't
even think of investing their money is 'bourgeois' enterprises]{.c1}

-   [proto-industry]{.c1}
-   [technological innovation transport system and development of
    infrastructures]{.c1}
-   [economic geography of the british island: ]{.c1}

[strategic location of layers of iron close to the seaports, which made
the cost of these raw materials low this was an advantage compared to
France, where prices were higher]{.c1}

-   [state institutions:]{.c1}

[the monarchy controlled the currency, which was homogeneous throughout
the kingdom and created optimal circumstances for a stable monetary
system; protectionist measures were also taken sometimes to boost
Britain's own production]{.c1}

-   [adoption of free trade policies:]{.c1}

[they were convenient for the british because they were the main trading
power]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

### [2. Belgium and Switzerland: a comparison ]{.c5} {#h.dgehzki0m0gd .c10}

[first two countries that completed the industrialization process:
Belgium and Switzerland]{.c1}

[↳ proof of regional specialization:]{.c1}

-   [areas of Belgium: specialised in cotton, wool, coal and the
    manufacturing industry]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Belgium]{.c8}[:]{.c1}

[John Cockerill: the man who introduced mechanised textile production in
Wallonia, close to a nearby wool district (example of interregional
dynamics)]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Cockerill became a corporation in the coal industry, the steel industry
and the engineering industry, and emerged as the biggest producer of
steam engines, locomotives and machine tools]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[soon the knowledge spread from belgium to other regions of europe
]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[the Botrange region in Belgium, the coal mines in the plains needed
huge investments ]{.c1}

-   [due to the need of capital, the royal institutions and the banks in
    Belgium formed]{.c1}

[the Societè General in order to become stock owners of coal mines (this
was the first time banks were directly involved in industry]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Switzerland]{.c8}[:]{.c1}

[industries located in small rural sites = workers were owners of small
lands and part-time farmers.]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

-   [watch making and pharmaceutical industry]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[the swiss industrialization process happened without smoke or the
involvement of big cities unlikely from Britain]{.c1}

-   [use of textile machine alimented by water wheels and turbines =
    advantage in the development of electrotechnical industries]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Switzerland was able to preserve its delicate ecosystems + grant jobs
to small labourers in the countryside]{.c1}

-   [machines tools are at the core of the industrial revolution, not
    the steam engine]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

### [3. French industrialization in comparison with the British case ]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9-1 .c10}

[France, with Russia was the most populous country in Europe, and also
the most culturally and technologically developed, but lost to Britain
in the 19th century]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[France seemed to have the best pre conditions:]{.c1}

-   [corporate entrepreneurship in the glass, gas, chemicals, and sugar
    industries]{.c1}
-   [science oriented innovations]{.c1}
-   [had the best infrastructure and lands in Europe, while Britain's
    were quite poor because the state did not invest in these
    sectors]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[it was due to the Napoleonic era that French industrial development
came to a stand-still]{.c1}

[and came to lag behind Britain during the industrial revolution]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[disadvantages:]{.c1}

-   [loss of colonies]{.c1}
-   [less export oriented]{.c1}
-   [family capitalism in textile and iron industry]{.c1}
-   [nobility conservative views]{.c1}
-   [the emergence of a peasantry middle-class ownership of land after
    the revolution that didn't favour population growth, leading to slow
    demographic growth]{.c1}
-   [weaker banking system: ]{.c1}

[Lyon was the only industrialised city and banks were only concentrated
there; banks mostly invested in real estate and agriculture, which were
main sources of instability that contributed to these banks' crash]{.c1}

-   [economic geography of French territory:]{.c1}

[the location of coal mines and iron mines diverged, and there were no
rivers in between; especially before the creation of rail-roads, the
integration between the two sectors could not occur]{.c1}

-   [inability of French agricultural and industrial producers to meet
    the growing worldwide competition for markets after the fall of
    Napoleon]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

### [4. Railroads and universal banking: features of German industrialization]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9-2 .c10}

[german unification: 1871 (economically considered as a pre-existing
region)]{.c1}

-   [backward compared to mediterranean and east Europe]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[the industrialization process sped up in the 1840/50s with railroad
building]{.c1}

[during the second industrial revolution the chemical and the sugar
industry became german trademarks]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[the building of railroads increased the demand of coal, steel and iron
(engineering industry) and made the local markets homogenous]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[conservative, not liberal:]{.c1}

[presence of high-quality work force in the engineering industry, which
produced German]{.c1}

[engines to be exported at high prices.]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[source of capital: ]{.c1}

[joint stock banks - not specialised banks that were spread throughout
the entire territory, not limiting themselves to nobility (they
integrated finance and industry)]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

### [5. Industrial regions in Italy, Spain, and the Hapsburg Empire and Russian Empire]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9-3 .c10}

[Italy:]{.c12 .c8}

[Piedmont and Lombardy were the old industrial regions that were fully
industrialized by 1900, Liguria industrializes as a maritime terminal of
the industrial heartland and other regions underwent a industrialization
process, such as in Veneto (wool), Tuscany (metallurgy, engineering) and
a few other regions]{.c1}

[]{.c8 .c12}

[Spain]{.c8}[:]{.c1}

[Catalonia was the old industrial centre of the country, with the
spreading of the textile industry the region was industrialized by 1900.
New industrial complexes were built on the atlantic coastline and
singular industrial sites in central and southern Spain]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Hapsburg Empire:]{.c12 .c8}

[Bohemia, central Austria, Vorarlberg were the old industrial textile
regions, with important metallurgical and engineering industries in
central Bohemia and Austria, electrotechnical industry in Budapest and
Shipyards in Trieste]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Russian Empire:]{.c12 .c8}

there[ was a great attempt at industrialization after 1880, which
resulted in a state railroad net, coal, iron and steel industry,
important industries in major urban centers such as Moscow, St.
Petersburg, and Poland. Russia was a strong industrial country, but not
an industrialized one]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

### [6. The path of the USA]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9-4 .c10}

-   [large population: bigger local market than Europe]{.c1}
-   [the USA was big on capital good while Europe had to rely on the
    colonies]{.c1}

[↓]{.c1}

[high wages and demand of consumer goods]{.c1}

[(in Europe low wages favoured industrialisation but limited the demand
of the working class)]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

-   [while Europe aimed new technology to save capital, the USA used
    technology to save labour and not capital]{.c1}
-   [marketing was a key element in american economy while in Europe it
    was irrelevant ]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Asia and Europe]{.c12 .c8}

[GDP per capita: parameter of average productivity of a country]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[1500s - Italy, Spain, Japan, Britain, rance, Germany, India and
China:]{.c1}

[around the same GPA level until the mid 17th century]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[after 1650s: northern Europe, mostly Britain and the Netherlands took
the lead while asian countries fell behind]{.c1}

-   [India and China became poor countries, they will start to recover
    only in around 1980]{.c1}
-   Japan was started its industrialization process around 1850s

### [7. Overview: Wealth, capitalism, urbanization, demographic development]{.c5} {#h.mslkt6mp7uv9-5 .c10}

[The leading industries during the Industrial Revolution were:]{.c1}

1.  [760-1840: textiles, coal, iron, steam engine]{.c1}
2.  [ 1840-1880: railways, steamships]{.c1}
3.  [ 1880-1920: chemicals, steel, electricity, internal combustion
    motors, automobiles]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[the effects on wealth and economic growth were:]{.c1}

1.  [increase in productivity through mechanisation in the cotton
    industry from 1750 to 1825]{.c1}
2.  [increase in productivity in the iron industry in Great Britain from
    1790 to 1860]{.c1}
