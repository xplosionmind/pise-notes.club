In XIX century, changes have been so deep and unprecedented that they can hardly be clearly framed.

Different interpretations of the changes which took place in the XIX century:

## European interpretations

- Progress of human capabilities and self-improvement, a point of view shared by those who benefited the most of the events of this century. European power influence and/or dominance created the premises for a modern societal structure. Brutalities and violence were a cost to pay in order to make progress happen.
- Socialists: industrialization supported and praised as a tool to improve the living standards of humanity, but a strong **denuncia** to the capitalist system
- Conservative critics: an idealized view of the traditional society based on local hierarchies, which they believed to be the best way to allow every individual to find its place.

The most negative points of view shared the belief of an evolution of society towards self-destructiveness, which was proved to be somewhat true by the devastating events of the beginning of the XX century.
