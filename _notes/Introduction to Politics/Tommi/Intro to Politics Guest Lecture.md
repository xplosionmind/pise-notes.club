A painful feeling of self-reproach that arises when people notice a discrepancy between their thoughts, feelings, or behavior on the one hand, and important norms and expectations on the other hand.

## Scoreboard diplomacy

Social sanction: publishing the disrespect of a deal or goal by some entity (nations, governments). Publicizing a transgression with respect to one’s previous commitments.

FATF: promotes standards against money laundry and terrorism. Countries which do not behave well may fall in the FATF blacklist. **Scoreboard diplomacy**: attempting to keep high standards by poorly classifying and discouraging trades with one country.
