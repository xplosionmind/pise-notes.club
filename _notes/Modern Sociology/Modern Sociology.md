# The Birth of Sociology

Before the birth of Sociology, its objects of study were treated by different disciplines,
such as philosophy, religion, and politics. Due to the process of cultural elaboration that
took place during the Enlightenment, its blurry boundaries became standardised and
codified.
Sociology is actually a very recent discipline, as it was born in the 19th century due to
the very nature of sociology; sociological studies evaluate and criticise social structures,
but, in order for this to occur, social structures need to be understood within the context
of a social existence, and not within the context of a natural or divine order. For such a
change of perspective to occur, it had to take place during the age of the Enlightenment,
characterised by the ideas of intellectuals such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-
Jacques Rousseau.
The ideas and theories of these intellectuals were mostly centred around notions such
as:

1. The refusal of socio-religious views
2. The refusal of tradition as the accepted “social norm”
3. A radical understanding of men (e.g.: according to Locke, human beings are “tabula
rasa”, AKA, the authors and the subjects of the norms they follow)

The development of sociology was also helped by the industrial revolution because it
brought about relevant economic, scientific, and social change in the world. This way, it
provided sociologists with a host of various social problems that needed solving, such as:

1. Concentration in urban spaces and loss of previous personal relationships
2. Bad living and working conditions
3. Tensions, criminality, diseases

There were quite a few approaches taken when sociologists attempted to find the
answer to these problems. One of these was the positivistic approach, which was based on
a strong reliance on science and brought into existence by August Comte (1798-1857). One
of the other most important exponents of positivism was Herbert Spencer (1820-1903..


## August Comte (1798-1857)

According to August Comte, society evolves over time (much like a big, complex
organism). He developed what we call an evolutionary theory, which is a theory based on
the assumption that societies gradually change from simple beginnings into even more
complex forms. Early sociologists beginning with Auguste Comte believed that human
societies evolve in a unilinear way towards something better.
Comte considered his Law of Three stages to be the most important. According to him,
human thinking undergoes evolutionary processes, and each succeeding stage is superior
to and more evolved than the preceding stage:

## 1. THEOLOGICAL EVOLUTION
The theological stage is the first stage that characterised the world prior to 1300.
Here, all theoretical conceptions, whether general or special, bear a supernatural
connotation. At this level of thinking, there was a marked lack of logical and orderly
thinking. Overall, theological thinking implies an unshakeable belief in some supernatural
power.
This type of thinking was found among primitive populations. In the theological stage,
all natural phenomena and social events were explained in terms of super natural forces
and deities, which ultimately explained everything as the product of God’s will. This stage
was dominated by priests and ruled by military men.
This stage has three sub-stages, namely:

1. Fetishism (a philosophy which believes that supernatural power dwells within
    inanimate object)
2. Polytheism
3. Monotheism

### 2. METAPHYSICAL EVOLUTION
The metaphysical stage started in about 1300 A.D. and is almost an extension of
theological thinking. It corresponds very roughly to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
Supernatural beings were replaced by supernatural forces in form of essences, ideas and
forms. Rationalism started spreading like wildfire.
In the metaphysical stage, speculative thought was unchecked by any other principle.
The human body was considered to be the spark of divinity. Lawyers and churchmen
dominated society. Law remained under the control of the state.


## 3. POSITIVE EVOLUTION

Finally, in the 1800 ’s, the world entered the positivistic stage. The positive stage
represents the scientific way of thinking. Positive or scientific knowledge is based upon
facts, and these facts are gathered through observation and experience. All phenomena
are seen as subjected to natural laws.


### Herbert Spencer (1820-1903.

British philosopher Herbert Spencer elaborated the concept of “social” evolution,
according to which humans adapt “culturally” to their environment on micro and macro
levels. Social change is thus a strategy for survival, where it’s “survival of the fittest”.
This concept was actually expressed by Spencer in his “Principle of biology” ( 1864 ),
written after Darwin published his “Theory of Natural Selection” ( 1859 ).
Spencer’s theory can also be referred to as “Social Darwinism”, as, according to him,
principles of evolution, including natural selection, apply to human societies, social
classes, and individuals as well as to biological species developing over geologic time. In
Spencer’s day social Darwinism was invoked to justify laissez-faire economics and the
minimal state.
Ultimately, Spencer believed that the process of natural selection acting on variations in
the population would result in the survival of the best competitors and in continuing
improvement in the population.

Both Comte and Spencer regarded sociology as a scientific theory, i.e., a method of
establishing a causal relationship between a set of concepts by relying on the
instruments of science. In practice, a good theory should allow itself to be tested,
supported, or rejected on the basis of empirical research. These characteristics are also
applicable to social theory, which is actually based on societal norms.


# Classical Theories

August Comte’s and Herbert Spencer’s approach towards sociological theory is present
in the typical methodological procedure of classical authors. These authors are:

1. KARL MARX
2. EMILE DURKHEIM
3. MAX WEBER

These three individuals can well be considered the canon for contemporary sociology.


## Karl Marx (1818-1883)

Karl Marx was a very eclectic intellectual, mostly known for his theory of capitalism.
This last notion in particular involved deep sociological issues such as inequality amongst
the population and how this would affect their social relationships. His analysis was based
on the study of how a capitalistic economy automatically places individuals into social
groups, and, according to Marx, the social position of people depended greatly on their
class status. With the word “class”, Marx intended to indicate what position was occupied
by people within the economy.
Marx’s approach is dichotomous because society is divided into two groups:

1. The owners of the means of production
2. Workers producing commodities and profit for owners

These two groups are linked by an exploitative relationship that operates at the expense
of the workers. The only way the proletariat can improve their agency, according to Marx,
is by acknowledging the fact that owners need workers to make the system work. If
workers refuse to cooperate, the capitalist system collapses upon itself.

THE EXPANSION OF CAPITALISM
The expansion of capitalism and its need to have bigger and bigger global markets for
its commodities create capitalist societies whose progress is defined by the extent of
their bourgeois capitalist culture, i.e., their adaptability to meeting the demands of
capitalism by producing commodities for domestic and global consumption. Western
capitalism has expanded to create a globalising capitalist world in which consumer goods
are the common global cultural currency.

CAPITALISM AND STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES
Capitalism is one way of organising production in order to meet the needs of our
existence; it is the mode of production that characterises our organisation of society.
Capitalism is a mode of production based on unequal private ownership of the means of
production. This inequality, according to Marx, is inherent in capitalism; it is both
necessary to, and a consequence of, capitalism.

MARX’S THEORY OF HISTORY
Marx’s theory is often referred to as historical materialism because he focuses on the
material (economic) conditions in society and how these determine social structures and
social relations.


History, Marx emphasises, does not simply evolve independent of individuals and of the
objective social relations (e.g., unequal class relations) which condition their lives. Rather,
Marx argues that historical change, i.e., change in the material conditions of society and
in how economic-social relations are organised, emerges out of the contradictions perceived
in the existing economic and social arrangements.

MATERIAL AND SOCIAL EXISTENCE INTERTWINED
Through production, we create and recreate a mode of existence that is compatible with
who we are as a species. Throughout history, individuals have always existed in relation to
other individuals, both physically and socially.
Individuals’ material existence, therefore, what people do in everyday life and how they
do it, is what matters; it is this “practical activity” that we need to focus on, Marx says.
Existence, for Marx, is not something abstract or philosophical.
Hence if we want to apprehend what is going on in society, the nature of social
structures and of social relations, we must study the “life-process of definite [real]
individuals ... [who] produce materially, and are active under definite material limits”. This
is what sociologists do. We don’t simply philosophise about social life; we go out into
society and investigate how real people live in definite social contexts.

PRIVATE PROPERTY
Marx emphasises that the notion of private property developed as the world became
more populated and more complex in its social organisation. Society has long been
stratified (organised into unequal classes or strata). Inequality is not the result of the
transition to capitalism or the result of industrialised, factory production. Rather, from
as early as the slave-owning Roman Empire, inequality has characterised social
organisation and social relationships.

THE PRODUCTION OF PROFIT
Marx singles out capitalism for specific critique, however, largely because in his
assessment (and in accord with his view of the progressive march of history), capitalism
had outlived its usefulness. Marx underscored the fact that capitalism is a system of
commodity production – its fundamental objective is the production of commodities whose
sale in the marketplace produces capital (money/economic resources) which accumulates as
profit for the capitalist. This, according to Marx, is what sets capitalist social relations
apart from those in ancient Roman or in feudal systems.
Capitalism as a system of profit production and accumulation requires the factory-
owner or corporation to maintain economic competitiveness vis-à-vis other companies, and
thus to cut production costs (including employees) in order to maintain profitability and
its economic viability.


### THE COMMODIFICATION OF LABOUR POWER

In a capitalist society, the capitalists care about workers only insofar as they have
use-value, i.e., the extent to which they can be put to use in producing something useful.
Thus, the extent to which use-value converts into capital, into profit, becomes the
criterion determining social relations in a capitalist society.
What is especially distinctive about capitalism vis-à-vis other historical systems of
inequality is that under capitalism, workers are free. The entwining of economic and
political freedom produces the historically unusual circumstance whereby in capitalist
societies, free workers (must) sell their labor (their labor power) on the market. And in
doing so, wage-workers themselves become commodities to be bought and sold. Capitalism
thus requires and is built upon the commodification of labor power.
The freedom under capitalism is really an illusion, Marx argues, because in reality
capitalism is a coercive system of labor exploitation. The movement of labor may appear on
the surface to be done freely, but it is in fact required, demanded, and coerced by
capitalism.
Accordingly, for Marx, wage-labor is in essence “forced labour”, whereas slavery is
“direct forced labour,” wage-labor is “indirect forced labour.”


## Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)

While with Marx we talked about social relationships, we now ask ourselves with
Durkheim: what is sociology about? For Durkheim, sociology was the “science of
civilisation”. He embarked on the analysis of “social facts”, which are the objects of
sociology. In history, you have interactions, events happening, and cause-and-effect
relationships between sequences of events. For Durkheim, in social sciences, rather than
events, we should talk about facts/happenings/peoples’ behaviour. We can look at this
through different lens:

- The relationships
- The patterns
- The organisations/institutions

In Durkheim’s point of view, society is not simply a collection of individuals, but is a
collectivity with features and characteristics of its own. It is a sum individuals that has
its own reality, which he calls a “suis generis” reality (a collective reality that exerts its
own force independent of individuals).
Durkheim emphasises that social facts are objective, meaning also that crime,
homelessness, and other “social problems” are, in fact, sociologically “normal”. They are
worthy of investigation to show how they vary in different social contexts. A normal
social phenomenon becomes problematic for Durkheim when its incidence becomes
abnormally high.
But if social facts are independent, how, then, do individuals, whose individual nature is
different from the collective nature of society, manage to live in it? This is the core of
sociology: analysing social morality, AKA, the formal/informal social rules that permeate
and regulate individuals’ behaviour.
The behaviours of individuals and groups are shaped moreover by forces and necessities.
For him, social facts are objects/things. Individuals react to existing forces, regulated by
social norms. Their ideas/emotions/behaviour are shaped by the collectivity. Different
parts of society are interdependent, and change thus can only be collective.
The methodological implications of this are that:

- Social facts have to be measured
- We need definitions
- We need indicators
- We need data
- The sociologist os an “objective” observer^

The above paragraph in particular expresses Durkheim’s views quite well: people’s social
position largely determines their repetitive pattern of behaviour, which is prescribed by
“law” (social norms and customs), and thus it is”external” to the individual and learned
through socialisation. If people do not behave accordingly, they will be laughed at and
excluded.
In emphasising the external and constraining force that society exerts on the
individual, Durkheim is highlighting that society exists independent of the individual, and
that it is a necessary constraint. Durkheim’s core thesis is that individuals are socially
interdependent. Social cohesion comes from individuals’ ties to others; our sense of social
belonging comes from our ties to other people and to the groups of which we are a part.
Social change, whether large-scale (e.g., same-sex marriage) or local (e.g., change in
the structure of the campus cafeteria), does not occur without a struggle; most change
is initially resisted as a result of the collective force of existing social facts. The
patterns and structures already in place cast a long shadow on people’s expectations of
what is “normal,” or of what functions effectively.
Although social change occurs, it is not simply willed by individuals. It has to be
accomplished collectively and in tune with collective forces.

## Max Weber (1864-1920)

A big concern of these authors is the question of freedom. They are all very political
thinkers with regard to how meaningful “social action” is. In particular, Weber’s sociology
concerns the interpretation of motivated and contextualised social action.
For Weber, ideal or “pure” types exist to orient sociological research; in his view, the
usefulness of any idea-type categorisation was to be judged in terms of the empirical
results it yielded in a particular socio-historical context.
Weber actually divided action into categories:

### RATIONAL ACTION

#### VALUE-RATIONAL ACTION

Weber’s Protestant Ethic demonstrated that values are a well-spring or motivator of
social action; in his perception, values, irrespective of their content or substance, not
only motivate action but can motivate rational action. Value-rational action occurs when an
individual or a group, organisation, or whole society values some ideal or belief such that
they decide to rationally act on that value, to demonstrate their commitment to that
value, regardless of the expected or unexpected costs of that action to them.
Value-rational action is “determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake
of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behaviour, independently of its
prospects for success”.

#### INSTRUMENTAL RATIONAL ACTION

Another type of rational behaviour Weber sees as dominating modern capitalist society
is what he calls instrumental rational action. In contrast to value-rational action, which is
driven by our commitment to a particular value, instrumental rational action is strategic,
cost–benefit action; we are interested in achieving a particular, rationally calculated goal
or end (e.g., economic wealth) and we assess the most effective means to achieve that end
among the options available.
We are motivated by instrumental logic, which kind of places us within an iron cage
where we are deprived of the freedom of being ourselves. In our modern world, material
goods have gained an increasing and inexorable power over the lives of men as at no
previous period in history, especially because the modern economic order is bound to the
technical and economic conditions of machine production which determine the lives of all
individuals.

### NON-RATIONAL ACTION

Here, we are motivated by emotions or traditions. Emotion is at the root of a lot of
social interaction. Weber recognised the socially meaningful significance of emotion —


categorising emotional action as a third type of social action, that which is determined by
the actor’s specific feeling states.

In the passage above, we can briefly outline the key difference between Durkheim and
Weber’s theories. While Durkheim explains society in collective terms, Weber claims that
society is composed of individual forces that independently strive to satisfy themselves
by means of “economic acquisition”.
This irresistible force drives them into an iron cage consisting of fixed and repetitive
patterns. This way, individuals are actually victims of bigger forces, and Weber is
sceptical about whether they have the ability to acknowledge that.

### POWER AND AUTHORITY

According to Weber, domination is the probability that certain specific commands will be
obeyed by a given group of personas, and ever genuine form of domination implies a
minimum of voluntary compliance or interest in obedience.
The reason why individuals do not acknowledge their status as victims is because, to a
certain extent, they believe the illusion that they can profit from the situation. On the
other hand, authority figures also feel that they have positive gains from this pattern
of blind obedience.
According to Weber, there are three types of authority:

1. TRADITIONAL
2. LEGAL/BUREAUCRATIC
3. CHARISMATIC

If this is reality, how do we understand it past what is apparent and superficial?
Firstly, it’s important to understand social behaviour and the meaning behind individuals’
actions through:


### 1. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS

### 2. QUALITATIVE RESEARCH

### 3. HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE RESEARCH


## George Herbert Mead (1863-1931.

Mead was a pragmatist who believed that human beings reflect on the meaning of a
stimulus before reacting to it (a notion called reflexivity). The self itself is a social
structure that derives from social experience, which is mainly interaction with others. In
this circumstance, individual experiences/reactions and shared meanings of words and
symbols are quite important. On the basis of these premises, Herbert Mead underlines the
importance of individual expectations and reactions.
The three main paradigms that Mead borrows from classic sociological theory are:

1. STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONALISM (References: Spencer and Durkheim)
Here, society is in equilibrium and is a system of highly interrelated structures that
function together harmoniously; people share the same values and know what to expect
from each other. Conflict is the disruption of that.
The sociological question arises: what is the role of this to the whole?

2. CONFLICT THEORY (References: Marx, Weber)
Here, society is constantly changing, responding to conflicts between groups to achieve
equality. Social order is the result of domination strategies from the category in a
position of power. It is functional to increase their wealth, power, and prestige.
The sociological question is: who benefits from this?

3. INTERACTIONISM (References: Mead, Goffman, Garfinkel)
According to this paradigm, society is composed of a series of person-to-person
interactions, and focuses on how the individual makes sense of the social world in which
they participate.
The sociological question is: what is the meaning of this?


# Michel Foucault (1926-1984)

The principal figure who transformed the body from a biological or physiological subject
to an object of social inquiry was the late French philosopher Michel Foucault. Foucault
wrote extensively on philosophical questions probing the nature of knowledge, truth, and
power. Foucault’s fame derived in part from the wide range of topics he covered and his
interest in challenging what we tend to think of as the “natural” order of things; how,
for example, societal definitions of sexuality are not natural or preordained categories but
human-social creations, and thus social constructions.

DISCIPLINING THE BODY
Weber was also interested in “discipline” insofar as it reflected and contributed to the
increased rationality of modern society. Unlike Foucault, however, he did not discuss the
body as an object of rationality in and of itself.
For Foucault, the history of civilisation is the ever-expanding increase in rational
surveillance of and over the body. Through the physical-spatial layout, time scheduling,
and supervisory and other organisational practices employed in prisons, hospitals,
asylums, military academies, and schools, modern society, Foucault argues, produces
docile bodies (that may be “subjected, used, transformed and improved”).
Foucault used the Panopticon, a model of a prison proposed by Jeremy Bentham in the
18th century, to illustrate how disciplinary power works and how its continuous
penetrating surveillance gives the individual no res.

BIO-POWER
Bio-power is the linking of biological (body) practices to economic and political power.
According to Foucault, this notion coincided with industrialisation and capitalist growth in
the 18th and 19th centuries, and in the related expansion of the nation-state and other
social institutions.
He elaborates how, for example, the Census of Population (a demographic data resource
that government officials rely on) became an instrument for monitoring and controlling
the practices of the body/bodies, as demographers had to categorise, document, analyse,
and publicise all those acts that people did with their bodies.

THE INVENTION OF SEXUALITY
Bio-politics and its technologies, according to Foucault, invented sexuality. Through the
Census, for example, we have invented the categories by which we come to label and
enumerate different sexual circumstances and behaviours. Foucault argues that how
society categories sex or anything else is highly arbitrary.


Thus, there is nothing natural about the Census definitions or categories; they are
administrative-bureaucratic constructs and, as such, are relatively arbitrary ways by
which we carve up the use of sex, and also too, how society controls sex. Sex is not only
categorised, but defined and regulated by society.

THE PRODUCTION OF BODY DISCOURSE
Historically, the bio-political production of discourse on sex meant that, like sex, the
body too became something to be regulated and controlled. It produced a “constant
alertness” among institutional authorities as to what was “normal” and “pathological”
regarding both sex and the body.
These institutional sites radiated discourse aimed at sex, intensifying people’s
awareness of it as a constant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to talk
about it.

CONFESSION
The incitement to talk about the body and about sex, Foucault argues, has a socio-
historical genealogy originating in the sixteenth century. This was when the Catholic
church gave increased emphasis to the obligatory ritual of confession. Because of the
Catholic prohibition on sex outside of marriage, sex became a prime topic of confessional
interrogation.
Thus, the Catholic confession became one of the core techniques of bio-power; its
procedures sought to extract truth about something that was omnipresent yet repressed
because of its “sinful" aura.
In short, the penitent was obliged through self-examination of conscience, and further
interrogated by the priest during confession, to “transform desire, every desire into
discourse”.

PRODUCING TRUTH
Discourse, therefore, produces truth. This “truth,” however, is a truth produced by the
institutional apparatuses, the system operating in a given society. Foucault argues that
every society has its regime of truth.
For Foucault, the confessional discourses extracted by the church, and the various
discourses produced by the state, the military, the medical and the criminal justice
systems, and by schools too are institutional regimes that produce truth. Hence, truth is
not something that is independent of society, of the political and institutional contexts
in which it is produced.
In his theory, knowledge has an “archaeology” and a “genealogy”. In sum, truth is
entangled in politics and power, and is far from pure.

THE PRODUCTION AND CIRCULATION OF POWER


For Foucault, power is relational rather than, as for Weber, consolidated in specific
institutional locations. Power does not flow in a top-down, hierarchical fashion, but has
many sources and points of shifting impact and resistance.
In other words, for Foucault, power is not contained in any specific location, person, or
social status; it is omnipresent and has no one anchor but continuously flows in all
directions.

MASKING POWER
The circulation of power as discourse is all the more controlling because it is
essentially masked in and through discourse. When we are talking with our friends about
the sex lives of celebrities we are not aware that the very discourse we use is itself
subjecting us to a particular, regulated way of thinking/talking about, categorising, and
practicing sex. We think we are just talking about sex, but we are really engaged in
reproducing bio-power.
Thus, it is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together. Therefore,
although we use a more explicit sexual vocabulary today, our sexual discourse also
contains many silences about sex and the body. We silently collude in various forms of
sexual exploitation including prostitution, for example, which tends to get discussed only
when it involves political scandal.

RESISTING/REPRODUCING POWER
According to Foucault, we are all engaged in the ongoing production of power, whether
we want to be or not. Discourse is power and we cannot escape from producing it even as
we try to thwart it. Individuals and groups are always within relational power struggles,
struggles that are fluid but also never-ending – “there is no point where you are free
from all power relations”.
This is where Foucault’s understanding of discourse/power may make us feel trapped
and frustrated – though he argues that it is more correct to think of power as a (never-
ending) struggle than as entrapment. Nevertheless, we cannot use silence or language to
reject power. This is because for Foucault, language is itself compromised by power.

SEXUALITY AND QUEER THEORY
Not surprisingly, given Foucault’s emphasis on both the historical-institutional
invention of sexuality and the arbitrariness of all categories, he was highly influential
among scholars attentive to sexual politics.

SOCIOLOGY’S HETEROSEXIST BIAS
Steven Seidman’s heterosexist bias is a bias stemming from the presumed naturalness of
the founding fathers’ “privileged gender and sexual social position” as heterosexual men.
In other words, when we read social theory we take it for granted that when theorists


write about “man in society” they are assuming a heterosexual man whose sexuality is a
given and about which there is nothing problematic.

NORMALISING HOMOSEXUALITY
The social movements of the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s that transformed consciousness about
gender and racial inequality also chipped away at the privileging of heterosexuality as the
only normal sexuality.

PROBLEMATISING SEXUALITY
In the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s, sociologists, gay activists, and others spent much time
debating the nature of homosexuality, a debate driven largely by the attempt to legitimate
and normalise hetero-divergent sexualities. This “sexual turn” in social theory thus ended
sociological silence on sexuality and challenged the conventional sociological view of sex
as an ascribed, i.e., biologically inherited, role status.

AN ESSENTIALIST VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY
The debate on homosexuality has many strands but it has revolved around two
contrasting perspectives. On the one hand are those who argue that homosexuality is a
biological given. On the other, are constructionists.
In the first view, frequently reported in research interviews with gays and lesbians, gay
people are born gay. This essentialist view of sexuality posits a core, natural difference
between homosexuals and heterosexuals, a difference used by some activists to advocate a
separatist identity politics that reinforces differences between homosexuals and
heterosexuals. The essentialist view is also used to support the political claim that since
gay people are born gay, it is not their “fault”; it is a natural orientation, they cannot
do anything about it, and, therefore, they should not be discriminated against by social
rules that exclude gays.

A CONSTRUCTIONIST VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY
The social constructionist view of sexuality avoids discussion of the biological basis of
sexual desire. It instead emphasises that all labels and categories in society and the
meanings attached to them come out of a particular socio-cultural and historical context;
they are socially defined and not prescribed by non-human forces.
In this framing, there is no one type of sexuality that is “natural”. Rather, the
meanings we assign to sexuality and what is “normal” and “less normal” vary across
societies, and within any one society, across time. In this view, people learn how to
present themselves as gay by internalising what society labels as “gay” behaviour; they
seek out social ties with others whom they perceive to be gay, and form various gay
subcultures.


### THE QUEERING OF SOCIAL THEORY

Steven Seidman proposes the queering of social theory. Most queer theorists are in
the humanities, and they approach social categories and social identities just as they
would the language used in literary texts. They regard the language used to categorise
social behaviour as a semiotic code — language used not simply to denote a particular
reality but as a signifier, an indicator, of a more deeply structured and culturally
understood context of meaning.
Queer theorists argue that reality is not binary; it is more complicated. For queer
theory, the key binary of interest is that of heterosexuality/homosexuality. Queer
theorists argue that political and scholarly debates about the biological or social nature
of homosexuality simply reproduce the pervasiveness of the binary, either/or categories
we use to think about sexuality. All binary categories contain an implicit hierarchy of
difference or of Otherness.
Dichotomised categories of opposites (e.g., heterosexual/homosexual; male/female)
overstate differences as well as projecting the presumption that one side of the binary
couplet has greater significance and value than the other: in our society, heterosexuality
is more valued than homosexuality; male is more valued than female. And these categorical
differences get translated and embedded into institutional practices.
The homosexual/heterosexual binary, queer theorists argue, reinforces the idea of
sexuality as involving basic foundational differences (e.g., of sexual desire, attraction). Yet
Arlene Stein observes that being lesbian is not simply about sexual desire but about
woman identification and the development of a lesbian consciousness.

THE REBELLIOUS NATURE OF QUEER THEORY
Queer theory thus pushes for a move away from and beyond the homosexual/
heterosexual categorisation. The queering of social theory, then, aims to be disruptive. It
is rebellious; “a theoretical sensibility that pivots on transgression or permanent
rebellion”. It challenges the very use of such words as “the closet” and “coming out”.
Seidman states: “I take as central to Queer theory its challenge to what has been the
dominant foundational concept of both homophobic and affirmative heterosexual theory:
the assumption of a unified homosexual identity. I interpret Queer theory as contesting
this foundation and therefore the very telos [progress/agenda] of Western homosexual
politics.”
The very use of the word “queer” in queer theory captures this disruptive strategy.
Queer theory thus seeks to destabilise the homosexual/heterosexual distinction and how
it is used to reproduce power and inequality based on sexual orientation, and in sociology,
to destabilise the discipline’s core heterosexist assumptions and knowledge.


# Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002)

Pierre Bourdieu emphasised the thoroughly social nature of social life and how it is that
a certain social order gets maintained. But unlike Durkheim, Bourdieu made social
inequality a key focus. In particular, he underscored how the objective structure of social
class and class relations conditions the individual’s everyday culture and social
interaction.
Bourdieu’s approach to conceptualising inequality and stratification shows the influence
of Marx, but especially Weber. Unlike Marx, who regarded economic capital as the basic
source of inequality in society, Bourdieu saw economic capital as just one, though a very
important, dimension of inequality.
Like Weber, Bourdieu conceptualised inequality as having multiple dimensions;
specifically, he identified the inequality stemming from individuals’ and classes’ differential
amounts of what he termed economic capital, social capital, and cultural capital.

SOCIAL STRATIFICATION
Bourdieu argued that we should think of society as being hierarchically organised/
stratified in a three-dimensional space characterised by different types of capital (or
power). Within a social space (any society), there are many different classes and class
subcomponents, all of which are primarily distinguished by “their overall volume of capital,
understood as the set of actually usable resources and powers – economic capital,
cultural capital and also social capital”:

1. ECONOMIC CAPITAL
What comprises economic capital is straightforward and easy to measure: money in the
bank, home-ownership and other property, investment assets, etc. While we tend to think
of the wealthy as a homogeneous group, Bourdieu highlights the differences within
economic groups (i.e., among those who occupy a broadly similar social class position). He
argues that economic capital varies and is a source of competition between what he calls
class fractions, sub-components of social classes.

2. CULTURAL CAPITAL
Bourdieu’s concepts of social capital and cultural capital follow a logic of acquisition,
use, and exchange that is parallel to how we think of economic capital, though these
concepts are more difficult to define and measure.
Bourdieu was particularly interested in how formal education and informal everyday
cultural habits and experiences enhance an individual’s cultural competence. Each social
class (and class fraction) has its own culture, and individuals regardless of social class


have a certain cultural competence. By the same token, different social contexts vary in
the value placed on specific cultural competencies.
Nevertheless, in the objectively stratified order in society as a whole, some
competencies are more highly valued than others. Specifically, it is upper-class culture
that is the most highly valued – it is the legitimate culture. In any case, unlike the
balance sheet we can read detailing our stock of economic capital, it is more difficult to
itemise and make a tally of individuals’ cultural capital.

3. SOCIAL CAPITAL
For Bourdieu, social capital is the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which
are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalised
relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition – or in other words to membership in
a group.
Thus, social capital refers to individuals’ social connections, the social networks and
alliances that link them in all sorts of direct as well as indirect and informal ways to
opportunities that can enhance their stock of capital. As with economic capital, the
accumulation of social and cultural capital takes time, and while each is distinct, there
are multiple links among all three.

ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CAPITAL IN STRATIFYING SOCIETY
Bourdieu is very attentive to the roles played by economic and cultural capital in
producing and reproducing social inequality. Economic and cultural capital are analytically
independent (though interrelated) resources.
Because all types of capital are exchangeable, an individual can use one type of capital
to gain more of another type. This is exactly what many economically rich people do –
they pay to acquire cultural capital.
Bourdieu uses the term “institutional field” in a somewhat similar way to how
sociologists discuss different, specialised domains of institutional behaviour in society;
he also emphasises that there is nothing automatic about the relationship between
economic capital and cultural capital. There is autonomy or agency in how any particular
family or individual chooses to use their economic capital.
In any case, capital is not simply something that an individual or a social class or
class fraction has, it is also something they use, and (must) use to show, establish, or
change their positioning in and among the economic-social-cultural hierarchies that
comprise society.

FAMILY AND SCHOOL IN THE PRODUCTION OF CULTURAL CAPITAL
Bourdieu underscores the sociological significance of the family of origin in determining
an individual’s access to capital. Someone from a relatively poor family can, through
educational qualifications (what Bourdieu calls academic or educational capital),


subsequently gain a considerable amount of capital. At the same time, however, there is a
close positive relationship between socio-economic background and educational capital.
Academic capital is contingent on the cultural capital inherited within the family.
For Bourdieu, children who grow up in families with cultural capital are exposed to
everyday cultural experiences and habits that cultivate in them the “natural” disposition
and habits necessary for success at school – success both in the classroom and,
importantly too, among one’s peers on the playing fields and in other daily activities.
These habits are also crucial to developing the individual’s more general “cultivated
disposition”.
Both the family and the school are engaged in cultural transmission, and these
institutions entwine to reinforce the dispositions and practices that constitute and
facilitate the accumulation of cultural and economic capital.

BOURDIEU’S IMPACT ON THE SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION
Bourdieu offered a dynamic and nuanced analysis of how schools worked that was way
ahead of his time. He highlighted the analytical and empirical independence of different
types of capital, i.e., that cultural capital can be autonomous of economic capital, he
advanced sociological recognition that schools produce and transmit cultural capital.
At the same time, Bourdieu’s emphasis on the linkages between economic and cultural
capital, and between family/social class and school, showed that while the school (or
education as an institutional field) has some autonomy from the economy and from family,
it is nonetheless positioned to reproduce the socio-economic inequalities that antecede,
are reflected in, and extend beyond the school. Importantly, however, this reproduction
effect is not automatic; the analytical separateness of cultural and economic capital
fosters slippage in the reproduction of both privilege and inequality.

THE CLASS CONDITIONING OF TASTE
He emphasised the social class conditioning of taste in all the “ordinary choices of
everyday existence”. These dispositions and tastes are not the result of formal learning,
Rather, taste is part of our cultural habitus. The habitus, for Bourdieu, refers essentially
to the everyday tastes and dispositions we actively and literally (though unconsciously)
embody, the relatively enduring schemes of perception, appreciation, and appropriation of
the world that we enact.
Similarly, Bourdieu argues that we learn – quite readily, almost naturally, as a result of
our own family’s class-conditioned and gender-mediated habits – to embody cultural
expectations of what “people like us” eat and do – how we live.
Bourdieu also elaborates on the class-mediated gender differences in the disposition
toward food and the body: “There is also the principle of the division of foods between
the sexes, a division which both sexes recognise in their practices and their language. It
behooves a man to drink and eat more, and to eat and drink stronger things”.


In sum, our judgments of taste are conditioned and structured by the intersecting
family and social class context in which we are socialised. We internalise and act on these
conditionings through a myriad of everyday practices.

UPPER-CLASS TASTE
In contrast to the upper-class habitus, the working-class habitus, Bourdieu argues,
produces a taste and style that are dictated by economic and cultural necessity. Their
choices are co-determined by the coincidence of economic and cultural necessity: among
the working class, conformity rather than personal autonomy is valued.
There is thus what Bourdieu calls an economy of practice in working-class taste, an
economy that also characterises the practices of all social classes.
Furthermore, Bourdieu emphasises that, because taste is produced in and by a class-
conditioned habitus and hence is a relatively enduring system of judgments and
dispositions, the individual’s taste does not change just because he or she suddenly wins
the lottery. “Having a million does not in itself make one able to live like a millionaire”. To
live like a millionaire, or as an upwardly mobile rich person, requires the acquisition of a
new class disposition such that the individual can be at ease in claiming as his or her
own that which he or she can afford.

TASTE IN THE REPRODUCTION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY
The different, economically conditioned class cultures of everyday life reinforce the
objective distinctions between the classes. One structural consequence of this system of
distinction is the reinforcement of class inequality. In sum, we distinguish ourselves by
the distinctions we make. Our taste reveals who we are.

LINKING MICRO ACTION AND MACRO STRUCTURES
Bourdieu’s discussion of everyday taste highlights his larger theoretical emphasis that
micro-level individual action matters in society, and at the same time, individual choices
are invariably conditioned by and work back on macro-structural processes. Ordinary,
everyday existence is saturated by society and we cannot escape from its structural and
cultural forces.

ENDLESS STRATIFICATION
Bourdieu adds to the sociological understanding of how and why structures of
inequality are so resilient. His analysis illuminates how individuals acting on their own
(socially conditioned) taste in making everyday choices about apparently mundane things
are really enacting practices and habits that are grounded in, reflect, and reproduce
society’s institutionalised social hierarchies. It cautions us that change in the social
order is a long and slow process.
