These are the notes I take while attending [***Philosophy, International Studies and Economics***](https://unive.it/pise) classes at [Ca' Foscari University](https://unive.it) in Venice.

<br>

## Purpose

The final aim of this website is to create an open set of resources for PISE students, allowing us to join forces and study in the most effective way by sharing notes and knowledge across different years of the degree and different topics.

<br>

## Completeness and reliability

This website was started by a first year clumsy PISE student: its content may be incomplete or not totally reliable. Many topics and/or classes may be missing but by [contributing](#contribution) you can help in filling the gaps.

<br>

## Contribution

Please feel free to share and improve this repository as you like; the only requisite for contribution is to be a PISE student, former student, or professor.

The source of these digital set of notes are is in [this GitHub repository](https://tommi.space/xplosionmind/PISE-notes), which you can freely edit.   
If you have absolutely no idea what GitHub is and how it works but you'd like to share your notes or contribute in any way to this website, please email tommiboom+pisenotes@protonmail.com

### Note
